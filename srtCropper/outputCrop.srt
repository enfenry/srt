910
01:18:46,886 --> 01:18:48,096
Move.

911
01:18:54,185 --> 01:18:56,146
They thought this was
gonna be a street fight.

912
01:18:56,521 --> 01:18:57,647
What are you waiting for, Toretto?

913
01:19:00,734 --> 01:19:01,901
No!

914
01:19:14,706 --> 01:19:15,790
Letty, stop!

915
01:19:20,837 --> 01:19:21,838
What are you gonna do?

916
01:19:35,018 --> 01:19:38,938
I don't know why you're doing this,
but I know one thing.

917
01:19:40,482 --> 01:19:41,524
You love me.

918
01:19:46,196 --> 01:19:48,114
And you are not gonna shoot me.

919
01:19:59,709 --> 01:20:03,004
You should've given him the case,
'cause I won't chase you.

920
01:20:05,298 --> 01:20:06,508
Okay.

921
01:20:07,217 --> 01:20:09,094
I will just take it from a dead girl.

922
01:20:11,054 --> 01:20:12,555
You willing to die for it?

923
01:20:30,907 --> 01:20:32,033
Let's go, then.

924
01:20:53,763 --> 01:20:54,764
Anything?

925
01:20:55,765 --> 01:20:56,933
They're gone.

926
01:20:58,351 --> 01:21:00,437
And DOD confirmed it was a nuclear football.

927
01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:03,273
He's got an EMP and nuclear launch codes.

928
01:21:04,733 --> 01:21:08,236
I don't know what it is,
but they're building towards something.

929
01:21:08,653 --> 01:21:09,738
Deckard?

930
01:21:11,281 --> 01:21:12,365
He didn't make it.

931
01:21:33,970 --> 01:21:35,347
I'm disappointed in you, Dom.

932
01:21:36,389 --> 01:21:39,809
When push came to shove, you were gonna
let Letty just walk away with the codes.

933
01:21:39,893 --> 01:21:41,019
You got the codes!

934
01:21:41,102 --> 01:21:42,645
Rhodes got the codes.

935
01:21:43,229 --> 01:21:45,648
You made the choice to let her go.

936
01:21:47,484 --> 01:21:49,486
And now I have to make one of my own.

937
01:22:01,665 --> 01:22:05,335
They are adorable little things, aren't they?

938
01:22:06,127 --> 01:22:07,921
God, I hope I don't hurt him.

939
01:22:12,676 --> 01:22:15,345
Look, psychotic, I did exactly
what you asked me to do.

940
01:22:16,471 --> 01:22:17,597
Don't do this.

941
01:22:17,972 --> 01:22:19,349
This is your doing.

942
01:22:19,683 --> 01:22:20,684
My doing?

943
01:22:25,355 --> 01:22:26,856
Da-dada.

944
01:22:27,023 --> 01:22:28,274
Dada.

945
01:22:28,692 --> 01:22:29,901
Da-da.

946
01:22:30,485 --> 01:22:32,237
Please don't hurt him, I'm begging you.

947
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,698
I don't want you to beg.

948
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,660
I want you to learn.

949
01:22:39,035 --> 01:22:40,370
Learn what?

950
01:22:41,663 --> 01:22:45,333
I understand why you did
what you did. I really do.

951
01:22:48,003 --> 01:22:49,129
Da-da.

952
01:22:51,881 --> 01:22:53,842
But it was the wrong choice.

953
01:22:54,718 --> 01:22:57,220
This is the consequence of that.

954
01:22:58,972 --> 01:22:59,973
No!

955
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:01,891
No! No!

956
01:23:02,058 --> 01:23:03,309
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

957
01:23:04,644 --> 01:23:06,271
Save your son!

958
01:23:06,688 --> 01:23:07,731
No!

959
01:23:34,924 --> 01:23:37,427
Can you pull up the footage
from the guy in the alley?

960
01:23:38,136 --> 01:23:39,220
Traffic cams.

961
01:23:39,387 --> 01:23:40,388
I got you.

962
01:23:44,934 --> 01:23:45,977
I knew it.

963
01:23:46,436 --> 01:23:47,729
I recognize that guy.

964
01:23:48,688 --> 01:23:49,939
That's Connor Rhodes.

965
01:23:50,357 --> 01:23:53,026
I met him when I was working
with Shaw's brother.

966
01:23:53,109 --> 01:23:55,403
He wanted us to get
the Nightshade device for him.

967
01:23:55,820 --> 01:23:57,030
Connor Rhodes.

968
01:23:57,864 --> 01:24:00,245
He's also linked to somebody
I'd quite like to forget.

969
01:24:00,325 --> 01:24:01,826
It's Mose Jakande.

970
01:24:02,535 --> 01:24:04,496
Warlord who tried to get God's Eye.

971
01:24:04,579 --> 01:24:07,248
Which means that's twice that Dom
has messed up Cipher's business.

972
01:24:21,054 --> 01:24:25,558
Everything you're feeling right now,
this rage, a sense of loss, it's not real.

973
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:30,897
It's a survival instinct
wired deep into our brains

974
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:33,650
to ensure continuation of the species.

975
01:24:34,859 --> 01:24:38,321
When early man would visit a watering hole,

976
01:24:38,405 --> 01:24:40,323
if they didn't watch their child,

977
01:24:40,407 --> 01:24:42,826
and it got snatched by a crocodile,

978
01:24:43,868 --> 01:24:49,874
our brains would create
a painful but instructional memory,

979
01:24:51,334 --> 01:24:53,086
so it would never happen again.

980
01:24:55,338 --> 01:24:58,425
This idea of "family"
that is so core with you,

981
01:24:58,591 --> 01:25:00,343
that rules your world,

982
01:25:02,345 --> 01:25:03,930
it's a biological lie.

983
01:25:05,682 --> 01:25:07,392
You don't have to accept it.

984
01:25:09,853 --> 01:25:10,895
I don't.

985
01:25:13,857 --> 01:25:16,860
Did you really think you
could destroy two of my teams

986
01:25:16,943 --> 01:25:18,695
without any repercussions?

987
01:25:19,904 --> 01:25:22,699
I wouldn't have even looked
your way if you hadn't done that.

988
01:25:23,324 --> 01:25:25,327
You didn't even know you had a kid.

989
01:25:26,745 --> 01:25:30,248
You can thank me for that and start
doing the job I'm asking you to do.

990
01:25:30,415 --> 01:25:31,833
Help you start a war.

991
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,835
Is that what you think I want?

992
01:25:36,546 --> 01:25:37,797
That's so limited.

993
01:25:39,549 --> 01:25:41,426
I didn't take that football to start a war

994
01:25:41,509 --> 01:25:44,220
any more than I took
your son to start a family.

995
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:47,057
Taking your son got me the codes.

996
01:25:47,515 --> 01:25:49,688
The codes will get me the nukes

997
01:25:49,768 --> 01:25:52,145
and the nukes will get me what I want

998
01:25:52,228 --> 01:25:56,733
today, tomorrow, and every day after that.

999
01:25:56,941 --> 01:25:58,401
And what's that?

1000
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:01,821
Accountability.

1001
01:26:04,282 --> 01:26:06,493
The second I fire off one of those nukes,

1002
01:26:06,576 --> 01:26:09,954
I put the superpowers
of this world on notice that,

1003
01:26:10,038 --> 01:26:11,581
when they cross the line,

1004
01:26:14,084 --> 01:26:16,586
I'm gonna be there to hold them responsible.

1005
01:26:18,421 --> 01:26:20,382
Because the truth is, Dom,

1006
01:26:20,924 --> 01:26:22,467
to the world out there,

1007
01:26:25,428 --> 01:26:28,014
I am the crocodile at the watering hole.

1008
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:36,314
We've got one last job to do.

1009
01:26:38,191 --> 01:26:39,442
Cipher.

1010
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:50,286
If I were you, I'd kiss my son.

1011
01:26:54,207 --> 01:26:57,919
Because whether
you value it or not, all of this,

1012
01:26:58,712 --> 01:27:02,090
your plane, your security, and you,

1013
01:27:03,091 --> 01:27:05,135
are still on this earth because of him.

1014
01:27:10,974 --> 01:27:13,730
The problem we've had with tracking
Cipher is there's nothing to trace.

1015
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:15,273
But now, we have Rhodes' information.

1016
01:27:15,353 --> 01:27:19,024
And we're getting snapshots of his data
before it's scrubbed off the net.

1017
01:27:19,107 --> 01:27:21,780
That looks like somebody's bank account,
so why don't we just go ahead...

1018
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:23,028
It's a longitude.

1019
01:27:23,737 --> 01:27:25,989
Given the fact that Dom
hit a Russian motorcade,

1020
01:27:26,072 --> 01:27:28,324
it's safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead and bring up the map.

1021
01:27:29,617 --> 01:27:31,578
Good. Let's start here
and run the possibilities.

1022
01:27:32,329 --> 01:27:34,998
Yalta, Poltava...

1023
01:27:35,081 --> 01:27:36,499
It's like they just threw letters together.

1024
01:27:36,833 --> 01:27:37,876
Kronyurt.

1025
01:27:37,959 --> 01:27:39,169
It's "Vladovin."

1026
01:27:39,377 --> 01:27:40,920
- What are you doing here?
- What?

1027
01:27:41,087 --> 01:27:43,969
Told you I was gonna check in on you from
time to time to see how you were doin'.

1028
01:27:44,049 --> 01:27:45,508
By the way, not so hot.

1029
01:27:46,134 --> 01:27:48,720
But there's nothing in Vladovin.
It's just ice.

1030
01:27:48,803 --> 01:27:49,971
That's funny.

1031
01:27:50,263 --> 01:27:52,182
Could've sworn there was
a secret Russian naval base

1032
01:27:52,265 --> 01:27:54,184
where they retrofitted Cold War submarines.

1033
01:27:54,267 --> 01:27:56,561
Well, technically, it's not Russian anymore.

1034
01:27:57,187 --> 01:27:58,188
The base was taken over

1035
01:27:58,271 --> 01:28:00,565
by a terror group of military
separatists about a month ago,

1036
01:28:00,648 --> 01:28:02,279
and the Russians haven't taken it back yet,

1037
01:28:02,359 --> 01:28:04,611
so there is a little window
of opportunity here.

1038
01:28:04,861 --> 01:28:07,197
Russian submarines. Nuclear football.

1039
01:28:07,364 --> 01:28:10,575
It sounds like everything we do,
our legs gonna be blown off.

1040
01:28:10,742 --> 01:28:13,995
It sounds like you still
number 11 on the list.

1041
01:28:14,537 --> 01:28:16,081
It sounds like you've changed

1042
01:28:16,164 --> 01:28:18,583
since your little punk-ass
facial hairs done came in.

1043
01:28:18,708 --> 01:28:19,793
Guys, guys.

1044
01:28:19,876 --> 01:28:22,212
Hey, we gotta call this in.
All the way up the chain.

1045
01:28:22,295 --> 01:28:25,090
That's good thinking, champ,
except unfortunately,

1046
01:28:25,173 --> 01:28:27,217
the Russian Minister of Defense

1047
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:30,053
got himself involved in a little
incident on US territory,

1048
01:28:30,136 --> 01:28:32,263
and the two governments aren't talking
to each other for a while.

1049
01:28:32,347 --> 01:28:33,973
By the time they do, it'll be too late.

1050
01:28:34,057 --> 01:28:35,850
So, any other suggestions?

1051
01:28:36,685 --> 01:28:38,728
Yeah. I got one.

1052
01:28:39,604 --> 01:28:41,439
How about we just stop them ourselves?

1053
01:28:41,523 --> 01:28:43,400
You're talking about a Russian military base.

1054
01:28:43,483 --> 01:28:44,651
Separatist.

1055
01:28:44,734 --> 01:28:45,819
Whatever. It's suicide.

1056
01:28:45,902 --> 01:28:47,362
It's stopping World War III.

1057
01:28:49,489 --> 01:28:50,573
What's it gonna be, rook?

1058
01:28:51,074 --> 01:28:53,159
You gonna close your eyes on this one, too?

1059
01:28:53,326 --> 01:28:56,287
Pray that the apocalypse doesn't come
knocking on your mama's front door?

1060
01:28:56,997 --> 01:28:59,332
Or, are you gonna saddle up, be a man,

1061
01:28:59,416 --> 01:29:01,918
and save the entire goddamn world?

1062
01:29:07,924 --> 01:29:10,385
You know, I think I figured it out.

1063
01:29:10,677 --> 01:29:11,803
What's that?

1064
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:13,847
- Rule number three.
- Which is?

1065
01:29:15,348 --> 01:29:16,433
There are no rules.

1066
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:21,938
What'd I tell you, Luke?
I knew he'd get it in three.

1067
01:29:22,105 --> 01:29:23,648
Aerial transport leaves in an hour.

1068
01:29:23,732 --> 01:29:26,276
Take whatever vehicle you want.
All bets are off.

1069
01:29:26,484 --> 01:29:28,194
- All bets are off?
- Bets are off?

1070
01:29:28,278 --> 01:29:29,612
Do svidanya!

1071
01:29:55,472 --> 01:29:57,140
Letty, I don't like telling you this one bit.

1072
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:59,100
But the game's changed.

1073
01:29:59,642 --> 01:30:02,479
Before, we were just trying to catch Dom,
but now, after all this,

1074
01:30:02,729 --> 01:30:04,481
I want you to know, if I have to,

1075
01:30:05,982 --> 01:30:07,108
I'm gonna put him down.

1076
01:30:10,153 --> 01:30:11,738
Then you might have to take us both down.

1077
01:30:13,490 --> 01:30:14,783
I'm freezing, man.

1078
01:30:15,241 --> 01:30:16,913
This ain't for me.

1079
01:30:16,993 --> 01:30:19,537
I come from a different
kind of lifestyle, brah.

1080
01:30:21,706 --> 01:30:25,168
Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with it.

1081
01:30:26,378 --> 01:30:30,340
I tried to take a piss,
I didn't even recognize myself.

1082
01:30:30,757 --> 01:30:33,009
Man, that's entirely too much information.

1083
01:30:33,176 --> 01:30:34,260
I'm just sayin'.

1084
01:30:34,427 --> 01:30:36,096
Well, one thing's for sure.

1085
01:30:37,013 --> 01:30:39,477
Dom's gotta be either working
with them or making a trade,

1086
01:30:39,557 --> 01:30:41,017
because no one would be this insane

1087
01:30:41,101 --> 01:30:42,686
to hit this place without a damn army.

1088
01:30:43,853 --> 01:30:46,022
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

1089
01:30:47,482 --> 01:30:48,692
Speak of the devil.

1090
01:30:56,700 --> 01:31:00,036
All right, Dom, you're one step
closer to that family reunion.

1091
01:31:00,203 --> 01:31:01,371
400 meters to base.

1092
01:31:01,538 --> 01:31:03,873
Prep the EMP. Let's take these defenses down.

1093
01:31:15,635 --> 01:31:16,886
We have a possible threat approaching.

1094
01:31:17,512 --> 01:31:20,932
Raise the barricade.

1095
01:31:37,407 --> 01:31:39,409
We've lost power, defensive positions now.

1096
01:31:41,537 --> 01:31:44,247
Gates are open. Let's get this party started.

1097
01:32:00,263 --> 01:32:01,890
- EMP is recharging.
- How long?

1098
01:32:02,223 --> 01:32:03,433
Sixty seconds.

1099
01:32:04,309 --> 01:32:06,853
All right, Dom, you have
one pulse left in that EMP.

1100
01:32:07,354 --> 01:32:08,980
That sub is heavily insulated.

1101
01:32:09,147 --> 01:32:11,316
You're gonna need to be right
underneath it for this thing to work.

1102
01:32:35,674 --> 01:32:37,133
Come on.

1103
01:32:37,217 --> 01:32:39,219
Engaging target. He's beneath the sub.

1104
01:32:45,433 --> 01:32:47,894
Mayday! Mayday! I've lost all power.
I'm going down.

1105
01:32:54,651 --> 01:32:55,652
Yes!

1106
01:32:55,819 --> 01:32:57,320
Two birds with one stone.

1107
01:32:57,487 --> 01:32:58,822
We've got control of the sub.

1108
01:32:58,905 --> 01:33:01,574
Dom, we are good.
Head over to the rendezvous.

1109
01:33:01,658 --> 01:33:04,744
Okay, Matty, let's take this baby for a spin.

1110
01:33:10,417 --> 01:33:11,584
Damn!

1111
01:33:11,751 --> 01:33:14,337
I think Cipher just rebooted that
sub to slave its command system.

1112
01:33:14,671 --> 01:33:16,047
What the hell is he talking about?

1113
01:33:16,297 --> 01:33:19,843
In layman's terms,
she just carjacked a submarine.

1114
01:33:21,386 --> 01:33:22,971
We can't let it get away.

1115
01:33:23,722 --> 01:33:25,056
There's the control room.

1116
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:27,559
If you can get me into that wheelhouse,

1117
01:33:27,642 --> 01:33:29,606
I can tap the network
and counter-hack Cipher.

1118
01:33:29,686 --> 01:33:31,316
Keep it from lowering into the water.

1119
01:33:31,396 --> 01:33:33,273
No, what we need to do is get me on that sub.

1120
01:33:33,523 --> 01:33:35,525
I find the weapons room
and I can pull the launch chip

1121
01:33:35,608 --> 01:33:37,027
before she can fire any of those nukes.

1122
01:33:37,193 --> 01:33:38,278
That is too crazy.

1123
01:33:38,445 --> 01:33:39,738
What you're saying is too dangerous.

1124
01:33:39,821 --> 01:33:40,864
We'll do both.

1125
01:34:05,263 --> 01:34:06,264
Knock, knock.

1126
01:34:11,353 --> 01:34:13,646
Five vehicles just breached the base.

1127
01:34:13,813 --> 01:34:15,482
They just don't give up, do they?

1128
01:34:24,532 --> 01:34:27,118
All right, let's haul ass, team.
Double time, double time!

1129
01:34:34,793 --> 01:34:36,169
Letty, let's roll!

1130
01:34:38,546 --> 01:34:39,964
Go! Go, go, go!

1131
01:35:16,209 --> 01:35:17,252
Change of plans, Dom.

1132
01:35:17,544 --> 01:35:19,629
I'm sending you new coordinates.
Head there immediately.

1133
01:35:20,005 --> 01:35:21,548
I'm done. I want my son.

1134
01:35:21,631 --> 01:35:22,799
I'll tell you when you're done.

1135
01:35:23,174 --> 01:35:24,509
Your team is in play.

1136
01:35:24,592 --> 01:35:26,970
Now, meet Rhodes and follow my instruction.

1137
01:35:32,392 --> 01:35:34,019
I've got you covered! Go!

1138
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:39,482
Move, move! Get outta here! Go, go, go!

1139
01:35:47,407 --> 01:35:49,492
Okay. How do you like this?

1140
01:35:52,787 --> 01:35:55,373
- Remote link has been severed.
- I'll take care of this.

1141
01:35:59,294 --> 01:36:00,628
Hi, Ramsey.

1142
01:36:04,507 --> 01:36:05,759
She's regained control.

1143
01:36:05,925 --> 01:36:07,177
Damn it. She's good.

1144
01:36:48,593 --> 01:36:49,806
They're entering the weapons room.

1145
01:36:49,886 --> 01:36:50,929
Oh, that's cute.

1146
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:58,687
Pull! Pull!

1147
01:36:59,062 --> 01:37:01,398
Roman, Roman! We gotta find the chip, go!

1148
01:37:04,943 --> 01:37:06,152
Oh, she's slick.

1149
01:37:06,403 --> 01:37:07,904
Gonna have to do better than that, though.

1150
01:37:09,989 --> 01:37:11,908
Okay, now you're starting to piss me off.

1151
01:37:27,132 --> 01:37:29,217
Ramsey, how much time we talkin' here?

1152
01:37:29,676 --> 01:37:32,721
You're smart, but not smart enough.

1153
01:37:36,224 --> 01:37:37,225
She's locked me out.

1154
01:37:41,271 --> 01:37:43,693
Tej, I can't stop her.
You're gonna have to pull that chip.

1155
01:37:43,773 --> 01:37:45,904
I can't! This thing's gone into attack mode!

1156
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:48,111
The door's not gonna open
until you pull the chip!

1157
01:37:49,154 --> 01:37:51,948
Tej, we got no idea
what the hell we're looking for.

1158
01:37:53,324 --> 01:37:54,326
I got it!

1159
01:37:57,287 --> 01:37:59,748
What in the hell are you guys doin'?

1160
01:38:00,749 --> 01:38:02,792
It wasn't me. It wasn't me, okay?

1161
01:38:02,876 --> 01:38:04,461
It'll be labeled "Guidance Go."

1162
01:38:04,669 --> 01:38:06,504
- Guidance Go, Guidance Go...
- Okay, I got somethin'.

1163
01:38:06,588 --> 01:38:07,964
- What?
- It says...

1164
01:38:14,095 --> 01:38:15,221
Do you understand that?

1165
01:38:40,246 --> 01:38:41,706
Wow. Nasty.

1166
01:38:55,345 --> 01:38:56,680
Quite a show.

1167
01:38:59,766 --> 01:39:00,767
We're arming the nuke.

1168
01:39:03,728 --> 01:39:05,397
(POWERING UP)

1169
01:39:06,147 --> 01:39:08,608
Nuke's going hot!
She's tryin' to fire this thing!

1170
01:39:08,692 --> 01:39:10,822
Roger that. We're moving out.
(OVER RADIO) Disable the nukes!

1171
01:39:10,902 --> 01:39:12,529
Roman, what are you seeing?
Come on, talk to me.

1172
01:39:12,654 --> 01:39:14,280
I don't see shit. I'm holding on!

1173
01:39:16,157 --> 01:39:17,409
And we have a countdown.

1174
01:39:21,037 --> 01:39:22,747
What the hell is goin' on, man?

1175
01:39:22,831 --> 01:39:25,875
We're about to launch a nuclear missile,
is what the hell is goin' on!

1176
01:39:25,959 --> 01:39:27,002
Pull the damn chip!

1177
01:39:30,422 --> 01:39:32,799
Countdown, countdown! Look for a countdown!

1178
01:39:32,882 --> 01:39:33,925
What countdown?

1179
01:39:34,009 --> 01:39:35,635
The missiles need to activate to launch.

1180
01:39:35,719 --> 01:39:37,387
The countdown timer won't be in Russian.

1181
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:38,680
The countdown...

1182
01:39:39,222 --> 01:39:41,391
Let's show the world what we've got.

1183
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:44,227
No, no, no! Don't press that!

1184
01:39:46,730 --> 01:39:47,731
I got it.

1185
01:39:49,899 --> 01:39:51,735
Something's wrong. It won't launch.

1186
01:39:53,445 --> 01:39:55,947
Get that sub outta there. Now!

1187
01:39:58,533 --> 01:40:00,076
Move your ass, Roman!

1188
01:40:08,043 --> 01:40:09,127
You all right?

1189
01:40:09,210 --> 01:40:10,754
There's nothing all right about any of this!

1190
01:40:11,212 --> 01:40:13,131
- Let's go!
- What about the missiles?

1191
01:40:14,382 --> 01:40:16,388
We got the chip. No nukes for her.

1192
01:40:16,468 --> 01:40:18,595
Hell, yeah. Let's roll.

1193
01:40:22,724 --> 01:40:25,268
Guys, we got company. A lot of company!

1194
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:31,358
All right, team, here's the plan.

1195
01:40:31,524 --> 01:40:33,276
There's a sea lock at the opening of the bay.

1196
01:40:33,485 --> 01:40:34,611
We get there first and close it,

1197
01:40:34,694 --> 01:40:37,614
we can stop the submarine
from escaping into open water

1198
01:40:37,739 --> 01:40:39,157
and disappearing forever.

1199
01:40:41,034 --> 01:40:43,787
I've got the location.
It's 10 miles southwest.

1200
01:40:44,037 --> 01:40:46,498
Ten miles?
We're not gonna make it ten seconds!

1201
01:40:54,005 --> 01:40:56,466
No, no, no! This is not good!

1202
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:59,719
What's the matter, Roman?
Forgot your snow tires?

1203
01:41:00,011 --> 01:41:01,429
Whoa!

1204
01:41:01,638 --> 01:41:03,223
You lovin' that Lambo now?

1205
01:41:03,598 --> 01:41:05,433
Whoa! Ah!

1206
01:41:13,316 --> 01:41:14,651
All right, everyone.

1207
01:41:14,734 --> 01:41:15,985
We'll deal with that launch chip later.

1208
01:41:16,069 --> 01:41:18,783
Right now, I want that sub
in deep water where no one can find it.

1209
01:41:18,863 --> 01:41:20,490
Find me the fastest route out of that bay.

1210
01:41:20,573 --> 01:41:21,574
Copy that.

1211
01:41:31,251 --> 01:41:32,669
Why are they shootin' at me?

1212
01:41:32,752 --> 01:41:34,966
Maybe 'cause you're in an orange
Lamborghini, I don't know.

1213
01:41:35,046 --> 01:41:36,840
Shut up, Tej!

1214
01:41:42,178 --> 01:41:43,513
Dom...

1215
01:41:43,596 --> 01:41:45,348
Do you really wanna put that car in gear?

1216
01:41:46,933 --> 01:41:47,934
Do it.

1217
01:41:48,309 --> 01:41:49,310
Huh?

1218
01:41:52,022 --> 01:41:53,443
I didn't think so.

1219
01:41:53,523 --> 01:41:54,819
They're heading for the sea lock.

1220
01:41:54,899 --> 01:41:56,154
They're trying to trap the sub in the bay.

1221
01:41:56,234 --> 01:41:59,157
I should have taken care
of this a long time ago.

1222
01:41:59,237 --> 01:42:01,698
Rhodes, take his team out.

1223
01:42:02,532 --> 01:42:03,742
I'm on it.

1224
01:42:09,456 --> 01:42:10,707
Roman, get in front of me!

1225
01:42:17,547 --> 01:42:19,257
Okay, y'all wanna play rough?

1226
01:42:20,433 --> 01:42:22,234
Now it's my turn.

1227
01:42:36,182 --> 01:42:37,759
Yeah, baby!

1228
01:42:46,409 --> 01:42:48,703
Guys, we got snowmobiles on the right.

1229
01:42:50,872 --> 01:42:52,248
They're gonna flank us!

1230
01:42:56,419 --> 01:42:57,420
No, they ain't!

1231
01:43:03,426 --> 01:43:04,636
Oh, shit!

1232
01:43:19,025 --> 01:43:20,026
Tej!

1233
01:43:20,151 --> 01:43:21,903
Roman, hold tight, I'm on the way!

1234
01:43:26,408 --> 01:43:28,493
I don't wanna go swimmin'! No!

1235
01:43:34,582 --> 01:43:35,792
Really, Tej?

1236
01:43:39,295 --> 01:43:40,672
Oh, no, no, no!

1237
01:43:44,676 --> 01:43:45,760
Oh, shit!

1238
01:43:48,513 --> 01:43:49,726
Roman, grab your door!

1239
01:43:49,806 --> 01:43:50,890
Tej!

1240
01:43:51,141 --> 01:43:52,437
Grab the door, Roman!

1241
01:43:52,517 --> 01:43:53,518
- It's so cold!
- Shit!

1242
01:43:54,144 --> 01:43:55,145
Oh, shit!

1243
01:44:01,943 --> 01:44:03,153
Whoa!

1244
01:44:03,570 --> 01:44:04,779
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

1245
01:44:05,488 --> 01:44:07,118
What is going on?

1246
01:44:07,198 --> 01:44:08,283
Roman, hang on!

1247
01:44:09,826 --> 01:44:10,827
Tej!

1248
01:44:14,539 --> 01:44:16,124
Get me off of this thing!

1249
01:44:16,499 --> 01:44:17,834
Tej!

1250
01:44:21,338 --> 01:44:22,339
Come on!

1251
01:44:32,223 --> 01:44:33,600
Argh!

1252
01:44:37,354 --> 01:44:39,689
All right. I've had enough of this shit!

1253
01:44:53,912 --> 01:44:55,538
Number 11, my ass!

1254
01:44:58,208 --> 01:45:00,877
Yo, shrinkage! We got a sub to catch. Get in!

1255
01:45:14,724 --> 01:45:15,725
What?

1256
01:45:15,809 --> 01:45:17,060
Depressurization alert in the cargo hold.

1257
01:45:17,268 --> 01:45:18,895
Drop it to 10,000 feet.

1258
01:45:19,729 --> 01:45:22,107
I know how much these people mean to you.

1259
01:45:22,190 --> 01:45:24,275
So I will let you pick the first target.

1260
01:45:24,359 --> 01:45:26,069
I don't pick a target from a mile away.

1261
01:45:27,904 --> 01:45:30,407
I stand face to face
and look 'em dead in the eye.

1262
01:45:32,575 --> 01:45:33,952
Okay.

1263
01:45:34,235 --> 01:45:36,245
The wife it is.

1264
01:45:53,388 --> 01:45:56,349
Nice plane. I'm gonna enjoy having this.

1265
01:45:57,142 --> 01:45:58,476
Hey, don't go gettin' any ideas.

1266
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,145
You and planes don't have a good history.

1267
01:46:02,647 --> 01:46:04,149
No shit.

1268
01:46:04,232 --> 01:46:06,943
Okay, let's go, Scarface.

1269
01:46:07,610 --> 01:46:09,112
These assholes ain't gonna kill themselves.

1270
01:46:12,824 --> 01:46:14,617
Pull up surveillance right now.

1271
01:46:19,748 --> 01:46:21,124
Surprise.

1272
01:46:22,751 --> 01:46:24,753
You're supposed to be dead.

1273
01:46:35,096 --> 01:46:36,059
You're driving.

1274
01:46:36,139 --> 01:46:37,602
- I said from the beginning...
- No way.

1275
01:46:37,682 --> 01:46:39,309
- I am not going to drive.
- I'm not driving.

1276
01:46:40,977 --> 01:46:44,481
We have a security breach in
the cargo hold. Take care of it now.

1277
01:46:49,986 --> 01:46:52,906
Jesus, Mum.
You're supposed to avoid the nerves.

1278
01:46:52,989 --> 01:46:54,491
Oh, shut up. Don't be such a baby.

1279
01:47:00,914 --> 01:47:01,915
Get to the pilot.

1280
01:47:01,998 --> 01:47:03,667
He's got the second key. Wait for my signal.

1281
01:47:04,334 --> 01:47:05,669
Give Cipher my regards.

1282
01:47:06,795 --> 01:47:08,505
Did Toretto hold up his end of the deal?

1283
01:47:20,225 --> 01:47:22,394
He gave us this little thing here.

1284
01:47:22,686 --> 01:47:24,688
No, no, no. Don't touch.

1285
01:47:25,313 --> 01:47:26,564
You can track Cipher with this,

1286
01:47:26,648 --> 01:47:29,613
but you can't do this on your own.
There's gotta be two of ya.

1287
01:47:29,693 --> 01:47:31,695
Fine. I've got contacts.

1288
01:47:32,821 --> 01:47:34,280
No, you're gonna take your brother.

1289
01:47:34,364 --> 01:47:35,573
- Oh, dear...
- Yes.

1290
01:47:39,703 --> 01:47:41,746
Toretto knows where he is.

1291
01:47:41,830 --> 01:47:43,415
He's got this thing. It can see everything.

1292
01:47:43,498 --> 01:47:45,875
It's like... It's called
the Devil's Bum Hole or something.

1293
01:47:45,959 --> 01:47:47,043
It's called the God's Eye.

1294
01:47:47,127 --> 01:47:48,211
Yeah, well, whatever.

1295
01:47:50,714 --> 01:47:53,303
There's no way I'm using Owen, all right?

1296
01:47:53,383 --> 01:47:55,093
He's a lost cause.

1297
01:47:55,176 --> 01:47:58,221
He's your brother, Decks. He's my son.

1298
01:47:58,722 --> 01:48:00,181
He's our family.

1299
01:48:01,057 --> 01:48:04,310
And our family don't die in bloody cages.

1300
01:48:04,686 --> 01:48:07,814
How can you talk like that about Owen?
I can't believe you.

1301
01:48:07,897 --> 01:48:10,987
You've gone and upset me.
You've really upset your mother.

1302
01:48:11,067 --> 01:48:12,318
Call yourself a brother? You're...

1303
01:48:12,402 --> 01:48:14,696
Look, come here... Mum. Okay, okay.

1304
01:48:16,823 --> 01:48:18,742
Every time.

1305
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:23,621
Owen.

1306
01:48:23,997 --> 01:48:25,206
In position.

1307
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:27,751
Go.

1308
01:48:29,336 --> 01:48:30,803
I'm in.

1309
01:48:49,064 --> 01:48:50,231
I've got the package, Toretto.

1310
01:48:51,274 --> 01:48:52,942
All 12 pounds of him.

1311
01:48:53,318 --> 01:48:54,694
Ah.

1312
01:48:54,778 --> 01:48:58,114
Dada. Dada.

1313
01:49:13,797 --> 01:49:15,715
You made me miss my shot.

1314
01:49:15,799 --> 01:49:17,634
What you think you're doing?

1315
01:49:20,095 --> 01:49:21,471
Looking at you dead in the eye.

1316
01:49:44,744 --> 01:49:46,663
That was for Elena.

1317
01:49:50,333 --> 01:49:51,334
Rhodes.

1318
01:49:51,501 --> 01:49:53,169
He's no longer with us.

1319
01:49:54,170 --> 01:49:55,755
Rhodes picked the wrong target.

1320
01:49:57,132 --> 01:50:00,927
Congratulations, Dom.
You just killed your son.

1321
01:50:01,011 --> 01:50:03,847
You're wrong. I just saved him.

1322
01:50:04,639 --> 01:50:06,850
And you just took your foot
off the tiger's neck.

1323
01:50:15,358 --> 01:50:18,194
All right, governor, it's gonna get noisy.

1324
01:50:19,362 --> 01:50:20,989
This is for your ears.

1325
01:50:25,952 --> 01:50:26,953
Good?

1326
01:50:29,914 --> 01:50:30,999
Let's go.

1327
01:50:33,376 --> 01:50:36,546
No! Stop him!
Do not let him get off this plane!

1328
01:50:39,382 --> 01:50:40,925
We got another problem.

1329
01:50:41,009 --> 01:50:42,719
That truck's got
enough missiles to take us all out.

1330
01:50:42,969 --> 01:50:44,095
Then don't give 'em a target.

1331
01:50:44,179 --> 01:50:46,476
Everybody, get in front of us,
line up, and we'll take the hit.

1332
01:50:46,556 --> 01:50:49,476
What? I need to switch cars right now!

1333
01:51:01,529 --> 01:51:02,864
Target acquired.

1334
01:51:05,784 --> 01:51:07,952
- Roman, here comes the bad part.
- What?

1335
01:51:14,709 --> 01:51:16,961
Hang in there, guys.
We're almost to the lock.

1336
01:51:17,045 --> 01:51:19,923
It's easy for you to say
when your ass ain't on fire.

1337
01:51:25,428 --> 01:51:29,099
All right, little man,
this might be a little scary,

1338
01:51:29,516 --> 01:51:30,934
but it's gonna be a lot of fun.

1339
01:51:42,404 --> 01:51:43,408
How's the music, good?

1340
01:51:43,488 --> 01:51:44,489
Ah.

1341
01:51:57,043 --> 01:51:58,294
They're locking on.

1342
01:51:58,378 --> 01:51:59,838
Sorry, guys, I got no tricks left.

1343
01:51:59,921 --> 01:52:00,884
What do we do now?

1344
01:52:00,964 --> 01:52:02,424
We start prayin'!

1345
01:52:24,988 --> 01:52:25,989
Hell, yeah!

1346
01:52:38,752 --> 01:52:40,003
There's Dom!

1347
01:52:43,882 --> 01:52:45,383
What, is this guy on our side now?

1348
01:52:45,467 --> 01:52:47,344
Who the hell cares? He just saved our ass!

1349
01:52:51,014 --> 01:52:52,891
Good to be riding with you again, man.

1350
01:53:06,279 --> 01:53:07,781
Toretto just cleared the way for them.

1351
01:53:07,864 --> 01:53:09,327
Someone, give me something!

1352
01:53:09,407 --> 01:53:10,450
Torpedoes are ready.

1353
01:53:10,533 --> 01:53:11,576
Then launch them!

1354
01:53:25,090 --> 01:53:26,091
Shit.

1355
01:53:29,844 --> 01:53:31,638
- Take the wheel!
- I ain't takin' shit!

1356
01:53:31,721 --> 01:53:33,139
Take the wheel!

1357
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:34,641
Where you goin'?

1358
01:53:36,393 --> 01:53:37,647
This is crazy!

1359
01:53:37,727 --> 01:53:38,937
Speed up!

1360
01:53:42,107 --> 01:53:43,653
- Left and back!
- What?

1361
01:53:43,733 --> 01:53:45,985
Turn the goddamn wheel
to the left really quickly!

1362
01:53:52,993 --> 01:53:54,160
Boom, baby!

1363
01:54:01,001 --> 01:54:02,085
Goin' for a ride.

1364
01:54:07,590 --> 01:54:08,591
Back in a sec.

1365
01:54:23,898 --> 01:54:25,275
- Where's that smile?
- Ah.

1366
01:54:25,358 --> 01:54:26,526
There it is.

1367
01:54:32,323 --> 01:54:33,491
You were gonna shoot a baby?

1368
01:54:34,784 --> 01:54:36,911
You sick bastard.

1369
01:54:37,871 --> 01:54:39,039
You're not gonna wanna see this.

1370
01:54:52,427 --> 01:54:53,470
Is that you or him?

1371
01:54:56,431 --> 01:54:58,224
Him. Good.

1372
01:54:58,558 --> 01:54:59,851
The torpedoes missed.

1373
01:54:59,934 --> 01:55:01,686
They're gonna reach the lock
before the sub does.

1374
01:55:01,770 --> 01:55:02,979
The hell they are.

1375
01:55:05,732 --> 01:55:07,067
Get ready for this.

1376
01:55:27,337 --> 01:55:28,338
Oh, shit!

1377
01:55:28,421 --> 01:55:29,756
We're gonna need a bigger truck.

1378
01:55:41,226 --> 01:55:42,894
It's right under us! Get out the way!

1379
01:55:55,156 --> 01:55:56,241
Get us out of here!

1380
01:55:56,408 --> 01:55:57,951
Why are you always yelling?

1381
01:56:01,913 --> 01:56:03,206
This bitch is crazy!

1382
01:56:03,289 --> 01:56:04,666
Look out!

1383
01:56:10,797 --> 01:56:11,881
That's not good.

1384
01:56:13,341 --> 01:56:14,884
That's not good.

1385
01:56:18,638 --> 01:56:20,557
Please tell me there's nothing
to worry about!

1386
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:22,058
We got this.

1387
01:56:34,696 --> 01:56:35,947
That's my girl.

1388
01:56:42,495 --> 01:56:45,168
The sub's too close.
We ain't making it to the gate in time.

1389
01:56:45,248 --> 01:56:46,458
We're just going to let it get away?

1390
01:56:46,791 --> 01:56:48,251
Not if I know Dom.

1391
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:54,632
You lose, Dom.

1392
01:56:54,716 --> 01:56:57,052
I destroyed two of your teams.

1393
01:56:57,302 --> 01:56:59,596
I killed your red-headed boyfriend.

1394
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:02,807
And I put two killers
on your untraceable plane.

1395
01:57:03,975 --> 01:57:06,728
You lost the minute
you interrupted my honeymoon.

1396
01:57:07,604 --> 01:57:09,439
Now guess who I'm coming for.

1397
01:57:10,023 --> 01:57:12,025
Put a heatseeker on him now.

1398
01:57:14,027 --> 01:57:15,153
Now!

1399
01:57:20,492 --> 01:57:21,493
Fire!

1400
01:57:25,830 --> 01:57:28,083
That's a goddamn heatseeker coming at us!

1401
01:57:30,835 --> 01:57:33,213
Peel off! Head to the shore!

1402
01:57:39,386 --> 01:57:42,138
All right. Come and get it.

1403
01:58:00,073 --> 01:58:01,199
No, no, no.

1404
01:58:03,076 --> 01:58:05,203
Dive! Dive!

1405
01:58:05,829 --> 01:58:07,038
This...

1406
01:58:07,205 --> 01:58:08,873
This is for my son.

1407
01:58:28,184 --> 01:58:29,185
Dom!

1408
01:59:31,873 --> 01:59:33,211
You're out of bullets, Deckard.

1409
01:59:33,291 --> 01:59:35,919
Not like I'm gonna need a gun
to take care of you.

1410
01:59:37,295 --> 01:59:38,797
How did you find me?

1411
01:59:40,882 --> 01:59:42,258
You want to see the old Dom?

1412
01:59:43,635 --> 01:59:44,844
Watch.

1413
01:59:47,931 --> 01:59:49,391
Resourceful.

1414
01:59:49,933 --> 01:59:52,102
You have a lot to answer for, Cipher.

1415
01:59:52,686 --> 01:59:54,521
What you've put my family through.

1416
01:59:54,938 --> 01:59:56,398
My mother.

1417
01:59:57,774 --> 02:00:00,151
I'm gonna make sure that never happens again.

1418
02:00:00,860 --> 02:00:01,945
To anyone.

1419
02:00:02,696 --> 02:00:05,035
There is only one flaw in your plan.

1420
02:00:05,115 --> 02:00:06,157
What's that?

1421
02:00:06,241 --> 02:00:08,535
Only one of us has a parachute.

1422
02:00:31,141 --> 02:00:32,642
Told you this would be fun.

1423
02:00:36,479 --> 02:00:37,814
Time to land, boys.

1424
02:00:48,408 --> 02:00:49,993
You know I never left you, Letty.

1425
02:00:50,076 --> 02:00:51,328
I know.

1426
02:00:51,745 --> 02:00:53,997
And you know I never will.

1427
02:00:55,498 --> 02:00:56,875
I know.

1428
02:01:06,843 --> 02:01:08,720
I have so much to tell you.

1429
02:01:09,387 --> 02:01:13,391
Yeah, you do.
And you can start with that bitch.

1430
02:01:17,729 --> 02:01:21,024
Now, that's Dominic Toretto.

1431
02:01:23,109 --> 02:01:24,110
Hey, Dom!

1432
02:01:24,194 --> 02:01:28,285
I'm just throwin' it out there,
we need to get up outta here

1433
02:01:28,365 --> 02:01:31,621
'cause there's all kinda nuclearism
happening under this ice.

1434
02:01:31,701 --> 02:01:35,038
Relax. Without the trigger chips,
those nukes are harmless.

1435
02:01:35,413 --> 02:01:37,165
Okay. So we good, then.

1436
02:01:37,457 --> 02:01:40,377
Let me go on and get
my young selfie levels up.

1437
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:42,879
You realize this is classified, right?

1438
02:01:42,962 --> 02:01:44,339
Not today.

1439
02:01:46,466 --> 02:01:47,512
Unbelievable.

1440
02:01:47,592 --> 02:01:50,095
All right, can we get up
outta here, now? I'm freezin'!

1441
02:02:17,956 --> 02:02:19,124
It's okay.

1442
02:02:19,916 --> 02:02:22,043
Don't worry. He's gonna be here soon.

1443
02:02:22,419 --> 02:02:24,170
I get it. Y'all got a lot in common.

1444
02:02:24,254 --> 02:02:27,218
Computer hacks, God's Eye,
geeks, nerd... You know.

1445
02:02:27,298 --> 02:02:28,925
But we got a lot in common, too, right?

1446
02:02:29,009 --> 02:02:30,180
Like what?

1447
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:33,638
We walk in the room
and we're oozin' sex appeal.

1448
02:02:33,722 --> 02:02:35,974
Me and you, hip to hip, is a problem.

1449
02:02:36,057 --> 02:02:38,476
I'm askin' a real question right now.

1450
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:41,813
Is it gonna be Revenge of the Nerds

1451
02:02:42,605 --> 02:02:46,276
or The Dark Knight? Huh?

1452
02:02:46,609 --> 02:02:48,611
To be honest, I like both of you.

1453
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:54,659
But just before we get into all of that,

1454
02:02:54,743 --> 02:02:56,536
let me ask you one question.

1455
02:02:56,619 --> 02:02:58,496
You can ask me anything.

1456
02:02:58,580 --> 02:02:59,706
Anything.

1457
02:02:59,789 --> 02:03:01,124
What's my last name?

1458
02:03:04,002 --> 02:03:07,425
When you guys figure it out,
then, I guess you can let me know.

1459
02:03:07,505 --> 02:03:10,175
It's gonna be Parker.
That's all that really matters.

1460
02:03:10,258 --> 02:03:11,593
- Jones.
- Mrs. Parker.

1461
02:03:12,010 --> 02:03:13,970
- Right?
- Hey, Mrs. Parker...

1462
02:03:14,512 --> 02:03:15,513
Hey.

1463
02:03:15,597 --> 02:03:16,890
Letty.

1464
02:03:16,973 --> 02:03:18,475
I wanted to thank you.

1465
02:03:19,017 --> 02:03:20,018
No need.

1466
02:03:21,269 --> 02:03:22,270
Well...

1467
02:03:22,604 --> 02:03:25,277
Cipher's still on the loose.
There's been some reports she's in Athens,

1468
02:03:25,357 --> 02:03:27,779
but she won't be nuking
any cities anytime soon.

1469
02:03:27,859 --> 02:03:29,069
Thanks to you guys.

1470
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:31,279
So, I got you a party favor.

1471
02:03:31,521 --> 02:03:32,906
This can't be good.

1472
02:03:32,989 --> 02:03:35,492
Your record's been cleared.
Full reinstatement.

1473
02:03:35,575 --> 02:03:37,122
You've got your job back.

1474
02:03:37,202 --> 02:03:38,703
That is, if you want it.

1475
02:03:42,123 --> 02:03:43,253
If I want?

1476
02:03:43,333 --> 02:03:44,334
Mmm-hmm.

1477
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:55,011
You know, after 16 years,
I figure it's time for a little break.

1478
02:03:55,637 --> 02:03:56,805
Wow.

1479
02:03:58,390 --> 02:04:00,350
Daddy's stayin' home.

1480
02:04:06,856 --> 02:04:07,899
Nobody.

1481
02:04:07,982 --> 02:04:09,025
Keep in touch.

1482
02:04:09,484 --> 02:04:11,069
Ah. Hang on a second.

1483
02:04:11,403 --> 02:04:13,571
This could be interesting.

1484
02:04:18,693 --> 02:04:19,861
What made you think I'd do it?

1485
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:22,125
Brotherhood.

1486
02:04:22,205 --> 02:04:25,834
I saw that look you gave Cipher,
knew you wanted revenge.

1487
02:04:26,167 --> 02:04:27,669
Glad I did it.

1488
02:04:31,006 --> 02:04:33,508
I can't believe you went to see my mother.

1489
02:04:48,815 --> 02:04:50,817
All this fuss over you.

1490
02:04:56,823 --> 02:04:58,241
Yes.

1491
02:05:03,330 --> 02:05:06,416
Elena, I promised to keep our son safe.

1492
02:05:08,585 --> 02:05:10,754
And now, he always will be.

1493
02:05:18,887 --> 02:05:23,183
I wanna introduce you to the most
important person in my universe.

1494
02:05:24,851 --> 02:05:27,270
One who never gave up on me.

1495
02:05:32,942 --> 02:05:34,027
He's beautiful.

1496
02:05:35,779 --> 02:05:40,116
You've heard me say that you
never turn your back on family,

1497
02:05:42,077 --> 02:05:46,122
and I wanna thank you all
for never turning your back on me.

1498
02:05:50,710 --> 02:05:52,295
You wanna meet them?

1499
02:05:52,962 --> 02:05:54,464
All right.

1500
02:05:55,298 --> 02:05:56,633
Everyone,

1501
02:05:57,967 --> 02:05:59,386
meet Brian.

1502
02:06:08,645 --> 02:06:09,896
To Brian!

1503
02:06:09,979 --> 02:06:11,856
Welcome to the family, Brian.

1504
02:06:11,940 --> 02:06:14,651
Okay, I guess it's my turn to say grace.

1505
02:06:15,110 --> 02:06:17,616
We thank you for giving us family.

1506
02:06:17,696 --> 02:06:22,075
We sit here in praise.
Thank you for giving us the strength...
