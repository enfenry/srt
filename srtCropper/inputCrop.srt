1
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:15,845
We swap in parts from Fords...

2
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,680
...Plymouths and Cadillacs.

3
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:20,349
My grandfather bought it in 1957.

4
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:22,143
When he died, it passed to my father.

5
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,811
Then my brother, and now to me.

6
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:24,895
Look at this.

7
00:02:25,555 --> 00:02:27,140
This is an engine from a boat.

8
00:02:27,223 --> 00:02:28,808
- No way!
- Yeah.

9
00:02:28,892 --> 00:02:30,852
Whatever it takes to keep it running.

10
00:02:31,227 --> 00:02:33,188
This is the Cuban spirit.

11
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:34,647
Your spirit.

12
00:02:34,773 --> 00:02:35,819
Don't ever lose that.

13
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:36,941
Dom. Dom.

14
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:38,109
It's your cousin.

15
00:02:38,193 --> 00:02:40,236
He's in trouble.

16
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:41,863
Come on!

17
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,335
You know I can't make a
living without my car.

18
00:02:55,418 --> 00:02:56,920
Not my problem, bro.

19
00:02:57,921 --> 00:03:01,591
Dominic Toretto, I heard about you.
Welcome to my island.

20
00:03:01,883 --> 00:03:03,259
Why you hookin' up my cousin's car?

21
00:03:03,968 --> 00:03:05,762
He needed money, I gave it to him.

22
00:03:05,845 --> 00:03:07,972
He can't pay, I take the car.

23
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:09,140
I just need a few more days.

24
00:03:09,265 --> 00:03:10,725
"Few more days" wasn't part of the deal.

25
00:03:11,476 --> 00:03:14,733
Come on. You make a deal,
you gotta live up to it.

26
00:03:14,813 --> 00:03:17,399
You make a deal, you gonna live up to it.

27
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:19,734
"Gonna" live up to it?

28
00:03:21,945 --> 00:03:23,488
Oh, so you're one of those types.

29
00:03:24,155 --> 00:03:27,016
You take everyone's ride,
and then ship it back to the States?

30
00:03:27,283 --> 00:03:29,327
You should show your people some respect.

31
00:03:29,786 --> 00:03:31,587
You watch your mouth.

32
00:03:33,206 --> 00:03:34,457
Now you got a problem.

33
00:03:37,794 --> 00:03:39,546
I'm gonna keep it about the cars.

34
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:42,507
I'm really scared.

35
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:43,967
You want a car, get it the right way.

36
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:45,552
How?

37
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:47,303
Race for it.

38
00:03:47,637 --> 00:03:49,472
I already own it, bro.

39
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:51,808
Not that car.

40
00:03:53,393 --> 00:03:54,794
Mine.

41
00:03:55,812 --> 00:03:58,606
Dom, his car is
the fastest car on the island.

42
00:03:58,898 --> 00:04:00,358
Do you know what he has under that hood?

43
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,819
He knows it doesn't matter
what's under a hood.

44
00:04:03,695 --> 00:04:06,698
The only thing that matters
is who's behind the wheel.

45
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:07,824
You think so?

46
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:09,326
I know so.

47
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:11,369
Then race his car.

48
00:04:13,496 --> 00:04:15,915
And we ain't racing no quarter-mile, here.

49
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,834
We race the Cuban mile.

50
00:04:19,336 --> 00:04:20,545
Done.

51
00:04:35,477 --> 00:04:39,939
I appreciate what you're trying to do,
but my car is the slowest car on the island.

52
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:44,194
Was.

53
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,113
Pull the seats, the doors, the battery...

54
00:04:47,614 --> 00:04:49,741
If it ain't the motor, take it off.

55
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:51,743
Laughing gas?

56
00:04:52,077 --> 00:04:54,079
Nah, Fed. This is Cuban NOS.

57
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:56,039
You guys are crazy.

58
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,209
What are you doing?

59
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:02,879
Poor man's turbo.
Pull the vacuum line and hold on.

60
00:05:03,463 --> 00:05:06,216
Old trick that Buster used to play,
in case of emergencies.

61
00:05:06,883 --> 00:05:09,219
You know that's way too much
boost for that engine.

62
00:05:09,552 --> 00:05:10,553
It's gonna be fast.

63
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,013
It's gonna be a bomb.

64
00:05:13,306 --> 00:05:14,891
Only needs to go a mile.

65
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:43,670
Are you ready for this, my family?

66
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,047
This is Havana!

67
00:05:47,757 --> 00:05:49,884
Be fast.

68
00:05:50,468 --> 00:05:52,595
Be safe.

69
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:56,182
But don't be last. Racers ready!

70
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:58,143
Vamonos!

71
00:06:35,972 --> 00:06:38,308
That car belongs in the trash, bro!

72
00:07:28,024 --> 00:07:30,276
- Where are they going?
- I don't know. Let's go!

73
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:46,459
Ghost him.

74
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,911
Sí.

75
00:08:06,271 --> 00:08:08,064
Adiós, Toretto!

76
00:08:12,068 --> 00:08:13,403
Okay, Buster.

77
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,572
Let's see if this works.

78
00:08:23,496 --> 00:08:24,706
That's impossible.

79
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,953
Look out!

80
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:41,176
A deal's a deal.

81
00:10:42,844 --> 00:10:44,012
You won my car.

82
00:10:46,181 --> 00:10:47,807
And you earned my respect.

83
00:11:02,655 --> 00:11:03,990
Keep your car.

84
00:11:05,075 --> 00:11:06,826
Your respect is good enough for me.

85
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,541
Yo, cousin...

86
00:11:14,876 --> 00:11:16,252
Sorry about your car.

87
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:23,843
Yours was too slow for a Toretto, anyway.

88
00:11:23,927 --> 00:11:26,596
Your Impala? Are you serious?

89
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:58,755

90
00:12:13,643 --> 00:12:15,186
Look at that smile.

91
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:17,355
I love it when you smile.

92
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:18,732
You make me happy.

93
00:12:19,524 --> 00:12:22,068
Mmm, I think this place makes you happy.

94
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:25,905
It's like it speaks to you.

95
00:12:29,492 --> 00:12:32,787
You remember that guy, the racer and his dad?

96
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,085
The one with the boat engine under the hood?

97
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:36,166
Yeah!

98
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,921
- Yes.
- Of course.

99
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:40,962
I was looking at them, and I...

100
00:12:41,504 --> 00:12:45,675
And I couldn't help but to imagine
what you'd be like if you were a dad.

101
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:50,347
No, no, no! I'm not pregnant.

102
00:12:54,476 --> 00:12:55,560
Is that what you want?

103
00:12:56,644 --> 00:12:59,022
It's not about what I want or what you want.

104
00:12:59,814 --> 00:13:02,442
It's about why we haven't asked the question.

105
00:13:29,386 --> 00:13:31,137
- What?
- You need a hand?

106
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:33,640
Yeah, I think I do.

107
00:13:34,432 --> 00:13:36,726
- Sounds like you're not getting any fuel.
- Yeah?

108
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,728
Probably the shut-off solenoid.

109
00:13:39,145 --> 00:13:40,605
Let's see if we can get some power to it.

110
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:44,734
What brings you to Cuba?

111
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:48,571
The same thing that brings
everyone else to Cuba.

112
00:13:49,614 --> 00:13:52,075
Culture, people, the beauty.

113
00:13:52,784 --> 00:13:54,160
What brings you to Cuba?

114
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:57,038
- Work.
- Must be casual Friday.

115
00:13:58,873 --> 00:14:00,291
How's that honeymoon going, Dom?

116
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:08,091
Your fuel relay is missing.

117
00:14:10,218 --> 00:14:11,469
I know.

118
00:14:15,098 --> 00:14:16,728
I love to play games.

119
00:14:16,808 --> 00:14:18,393
I've beaten the best of 'em.

120
00:14:19,436 --> 00:14:21,813
But I'm kind of in a rush,
so if you've got something to say to me...

121
00:14:21,896 --> 00:14:24,274
Oh, this is a very different game,
that I can assure you.

122
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:29,612
This... There's something
much greater at work here.

123
00:14:30,405 --> 00:14:31,406
This is fate.

124
00:14:32,115 --> 00:14:33,742
I choose to make my own fate.

125
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,368
Not today.

126
00:14:35,994 --> 00:14:38,997
Is this the road you take
to your apartment every morning?

127
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:42,167
What else is different, Dom?
Was Santiago's closed?

128
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:44,461
Did you have to cross two blocks
to go get your Cuban coffees?

129
00:14:44,544 --> 00:14:46,796
What is it, black, no sugar?

130
00:14:48,256 --> 00:14:49,299
Yeah.

131
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:51,801
I put a lot of work into
getting you here today.

132
00:14:52,677 --> 00:14:54,304
Well, now that I'm here, what do you want?

133
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:56,014
I want you to work for me.

134
00:14:57,682 --> 00:14:58,683
Work for you?

135
00:14:59,184 --> 00:15:01,353
Oh, I could've saved you a lot of time, then.

136
00:15:01,811 --> 00:15:03,229
See, I don't work for anyone.

137
00:15:03,813 --> 00:15:05,735
You can't walk away from this, Dom.

138
00:15:05,815 --> 00:15:08,318
We're gonna have this conversation,
one way or the other.

139
00:15:09,736 --> 00:15:11,529
You see, that's the funny thing about fate.

140
00:15:12,447 --> 00:15:13,615
It's cunning.

141
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:17,827
It can bring you beautiful things,
and it can also bring you moments like this.

142
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:34,135
Oh, you're gonna want to work for me.

143
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:38,935
You're gonna betray your brothers,
abandon your code, and shatter your family.

144
00:15:39,015 --> 00:15:43,520
You see, your team is about to go up
against the only thing they can't handle.

145
00:15:44,521 --> 00:15:45,522
What's that?

146
00:15:47,524 --> 00:15:48,858
You.

147
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:53,113
Oh, and, Dom,
I wouldn't mention this to anyone.

148
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:05,709
They are gonna be hitting us
with everything they got.

149
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:08,006
So we wanna engage with maximum speed.

150
00:16:08,086 --> 00:16:11,506
Neutralize their shooters,
and then move on to our objective.

151
00:16:11,673 --> 00:16:13,717
There's two things
I want you to keep in mind.

152
00:16:13,883 --> 00:16:16,306
Number one, I chose you for this squad

153
00:16:16,386 --> 00:16:20,265
because you are the most
fearsome warriors on the planet.

154
00:16:20,348 --> 00:16:22,354
And number two, you go out there,

155
00:16:22,434 --> 00:16:25,190
you do your job, and you take 'em down.

156
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,522
Everyone. And I mean everyone.

157
00:16:28,273 --> 00:16:31,151
Mani's and pedi's at the mall later on today.

158
00:16:36,313 --> 00:16:37,782
Monarchs!

159
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,581
What?

160
00:17:30,627 --> 00:17:31,961
I don't wanna play anymore.

161
00:17:33,797 --> 00:17:35,465
All right, let's go, girls.
Let's go, let's go!

162
00:17:35,632 --> 00:17:36,633
Final two minutes.

163
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,801
Quite the cheering section.

164
00:17:41,346 --> 00:17:42,347
Oh, yeah.

165
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:44,974
Yeah, it's the moms.
They come out to support the kids.

166
00:17:45,141 --> 00:17:47,435
Except there seem to be more moms than kids.

167
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:48,978
Way more moms.

168
00:17:52,265 --> 00:17:54,446
Yeah. It's a big soccer town.

169
00:17:54,526 --> 00:17:55,652
Let's go, girls!

170
00:17:55,944 --> 00:17:57,570
So, your intel was spot-on.

171
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:00,156
That Damocles 7 EMP weapon
that went missing in the Gulf?

172
00:18:00,448 --> 00:18:03,118
Arms dealers from the Liberation
Front have it in Berlin.

173
00:18:03,201 --> 00:18:04,244
Shit!

174
00:18:04,327 --> 00:18:07,083
This thing can wipe out
an entire electrical grid in a major city.

175
00:18:07,163 --> 00:18:08,623
No lights, no power.

176
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,791
Instant Stone Age.

177
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,210
Chloe, Maya,
you can't let her run by you like that.

178
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:15,422
- Let's go, let's go! Cross!
- Agent Hobbs, this is a Class Four WMD.

179
00:18:15,505 --> 00:18:16,840
Do you have any idea what's at stake here?

180
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:19,592
Yes, I know exactly
what is at stake here, okay?

181
00:18:19,676 --> 00:18:23,304
If the Pink Butterflies beat my Red Dragons,
that means we lose the championship.

182
00:18:24,472 --> 00:18:27,604
Which means I have 20 little girls who
are crying, and that's not a good thing.

183
00:18:27,684 --> 00:18:30,482
Which then means I have to spend
a lot of time in ice-cream shops

184
00:18:30,562 --> 00:18:32,313
and a lot of time at Tay Tay concerts.

185
00:18:32,856 --> 00:18:33,898
Tay Tay?

186
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:38,403
Taylor Swift. Gotta be shittin' me.
Get it together, okay?

187
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,571
Let's go, girls!

188
00:18:39,738 --> 00:18:42,032
We need you to do this.
It's a lot of lives at stake.

189
00:18:42,198 --> 00:18:43,742
All right, but I need to be clear here.

190
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:46,786
The US government cannot sanction
this operation in any way.

191
00:18:47,037 --> 00:18:48,204
- You're on your own.
- Hey.

192
00:18:48,371 --> 00:18:50,790
If this thing goes sideways,
you don't just get burned.

193
00:18:50,957 --> 00:18:52,167
You go to prison.

194
00:18:52,751 --> 00:18:54,669
And there's nothing we can do to get you out.

195
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:56,921
Let me tell you something.

196
00:18:57,464 --> 00:19:02,469
The only thing that I love more
than saving lives is my daughter.

197
00:19:02,635 --> 00:19:05,430
So, if you don't shut up
with this government bullshit right now,

198
00:19:05,597 --> 00:19:10,310
and start showing some team spirit
and respect for the Red Dragons,

199
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:14,147
I'm gonna have all 20 of them line up
and kick you right in the tay-tay.

200
00:19:17,275 --> 00:19:18,443
Go Dragons!

201
00:19:19,486 --> 00:19:20,570
Say it again.

202
00:19:20,737 --> 00:19:21,946
Go Dragons!

203
00:19:22,113 --> 00:19:24,074
Attaboy. Go Dragons.

204
00:19:24,407 --> 00:19:25,617
Go Dragons.

205
00:19:25,784 --> 00:19:28,078
- I'm open.
- She's open! Go, go!

206
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,496
Yes!

207
00:19:30,997 --> 00:19:32,916
That is my daughter right there. Yes.

208
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,171
Yes, come here.

209
00:19:35,251 --> 00:19:36,252
How did I do?

210
00:19:36,586 --> 00:19:37,587
Awesome.

211
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:38,672
Nice job, kid.

212
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:47,088
- Daddy's gotta go to work?
- Uh, yeah. Daddy's gotta go to work.

213
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:49,224
Now, you're gonna need
to get a team you can trust.

214
00:19:50,141 --> 00:19:51,434
Oh, I already got one.

215
00:20:12,706 --> 00:20:13,707
Hey, Dom.

216
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,041
Hey, Hobbs.

217
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,293
I got a job in Berlin
and I need a favor, brother.

218
00:20:19,462 --> 00:20:22,132
No problem.
I'll grab the team and meet you in Berlin.

219
00:20:22,716 --> 00:20:24,718
Thanks, man. I'll see you soon.

220
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:53,830
You were only supposed
to create a diversion, Roman.

221
00:20:53,913 --> 00:20:54,960
That was a diversion!

222
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,791
How many of the damn explosives did you use?

223
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,460
I don't know, Tej.

224
00:20:58,543 --> 00:21:00,045
- All of it?
- Wait, all of it?

225
00:21:00,211 --> 00:21:02,130
Roman, Jesus Christ.

226
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:03,882
We got more of your fan club ahead.

227
00:21:10,347 --> 00:21:11,389
They're still on us!

228
00:21:12,223 --> 00:21:13,558
These guys are taking this personal.

229
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:16,982
Roman, we just blew up their facility
and stole their EMP.

230
00:21:17,062 --> 00:21:20,815
Other than your doctor's cold finger,
I'd say it's about as personal as it can get.

231
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:22,359
Phase Two!

232
00:21:22,442 --> 00:21:25,028
Phase Two? So you just
gonna keep that to yourself?

233
00:21:25,195 --> 00:21:27,822
What happened to Phase One?
What about that part?

234
00:21:27,989 --> 00:21:29,366
Yeah. Remember the airplane?

235
00:21:29,532 --> 00:21:30,992
Everyone drove their cars out but you?

236
00:21:31,493 --> 00:21:33,328
I told you, my engine seized up.

237
00:21:33,495 --> 00:21:34,621
It's your balls that seized up.

238
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:35,955
Just follow my lead, okay?

239
00:21:36,122 --> 00:21:38,541
And, Roman, whatever you do, don't think.

240
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:39,959
Huh?

241
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:41,336
Tej, drop it!

242
00:21:41,878 --> 00:21:43,046
Bombs away.

243
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,132
Split, now!

244
00:21:50,512 --> 00:21:51,763
Holy...

245
00:22:07,112 --> 00:22:08,571
Great plan, Tej.

246
00:22:08,947 --> 00:22:11,032
But just so you know, you missed some.

247
00:22:11,241 --> 00:22:12,742
Oh, just wait for it.

248
00:22:25,422 --> 00:22:27,424
Oh, shit!

249
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:30,385
I hate you, Tej!

250
00:22:32,637 --> 00:22:33,722
Got your ass.

251
00:22:39,978 --> 00:22:41,062
You good?

252
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,899
I'll see you when it's done.

253
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,196
All right, great job, team.

254
00:22:50,363 --> 00:22:52,115
Let's break off and meet me
at the safe house.

255
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:08,048
A hell of a job, brother.

256
00:23:08,298 --> 00:23:10,300
When we get back to the base,
the beer's on me.

257
00:23:34,532 --> 00:23:36,326
You lost your goddamn mind, Toretto?

258
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,665
Toretto, you put hands on that thing,

259
00:23:41,748 --> 00:23:44,334
you're gonna have the whole world
gunning for you, including me.

260
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:52,467
I don't know what you're doing,
but you better think about this, Toretto.

261
00:23:53,468 --> 00:23:55,095
It ain't too late to stop this.

262
00:24:07,565 --> 00:24:08,858
It is now.

263
00:24:13,988 --> 00:24:16,032
That sumbitch just crossed us.

264
00:24:16,408 --> 00:24:18,455
- What?
- Wait a second, what are you talking about?

265
00:24:18,535 --> 00:24:19,536
Dom took the EMP.

266
00:24:19,744 --> 00:24:20,787
Bullshit.

267
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,831
Where are you?

268
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,165
It's too late for me. Get outta here.

269
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:28,128
Saw that look in his eye,
and I've seen that look before.

270
00:24:28,962 --> 00:24:31,047
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.

271
00:25:33,193 --> 00:25:35,153
All right, I got his phone records, y'all.

272
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,697
It's a whole bunch of calls
to untraceable numbers.

273
00:25:37,906 --> 00:25:38,907
Burner phones, right?

274
00:25:39,074 --> 00:25:40,325
Nah, scrambler.

275
00:25:40,492 --> 00:25:43,536
Same number, but they got some sort
of micro-router to bury the signal path,

276
00:25:43,703 --> 00:25:47,499
which means Dom is clearly communicating
with somebody that's above our pay grade.

277
00:25:47,749 --> 00:25:51,628
Look, I don't know Dom as well as you,
but if we just look at the facts,

278
00:25:52,295 --> 00:25:54,798
Dom's been having highly
encrypted conversations

279
00:25:54,964 --> 00:25:56,424
with some mysterious person.

280
00:25:58,134 --> 00:25:59,511
He took out Hobbs.

281
00:26:00,095 --> 00:26:01,846
He stole an EMP. Now he's disappeared.

282
00:26:02,722 --> 00:26:03,890
So, what are you saying?

283
00:26:04,057 --> 00:26:06,976
Maybe we should consider
the fact that Hobbs is right.

284
00:26:07,644 --> 00:26:09,395
Dom did go rogue.

285
00:26:10,355 --> 00:26:11,356
Letty.

286
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:13,400
Before you judge the man,

287
00:26:13,566 --> 00:26:16,653
remember, you're breathing right
now because he saved your life.

288
00:26:24,995 --> 00:26:26,997
You just gonna let her bump
your shoulder like that?

289
00:26:27,747 --> 00:26:30,959
I'm just saying,
that was a little aggressive.

290
00:26:33,336 --> 00:26:35,204
What you gonna do, email her?

291
00:26:37,924 --> 00:26:38,967
Check.

292
00:26:50,103 --> 00:26:51,229
Moment, will you, fellas?

293
00:26:52,647 --> 00:26:53,940
Thank you.

294
00:26:54,107 --> 00:26:55,525
Well, this is an exciting new look.

295
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:58,236
It's a little tight in the crotch, as always.

296
00:26:59,612 --> 00:27:01,656
What boy-band bus did she fall out of?

297
00:27:02,323 --> 00:27:03,658
It's my new junior associate.

298
00:27:03,825 --> 00:27:05,744
He's working with me on this. All yours.

299
00:27:05,827 --> 00:27:08,288
Mr. Nobody and I have been given
the authority to get you out of this.

300
00:27:08,705 --> 00:27:11,624
All you have to do is agree
to the terms and you're free.

301
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:14,627
What's training wheels talking about?
What terms?

302
00:27:15,253 --> 00:27:16,838
Confess to your crimes in Berlin.

303
00:27:17,297 --> 00:27:21,176
Treason, international espionage,
massive destruction of civic property.

304
00:27:21,426 --> 00:27:23,011
You do that, we close the case.

305
00:27:23,428 --> 00:27:25,555
- And?
- And the DSS blacklists you.

306
00:27:25,722 --> 00:27:27,057
Germany loves that.

307
00:27:27,223 --> 00:27:28,808
Officially, you will be a criminal.

308
00:27:28,892 --> 00:27:29,893
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

309
00:27:29,976 --> 00:27:31,686
You need to work on your delivery, all right?

310
00:27:31,895 --> 00:27:33,271
Unofficially...

311
00:27:34,731 --> 00:27:37,233
You're off the books. You come work with me.

312
00:27:38,902 --> 00:27:39,903
I'm not a criminal.

313
00:27:39,986 --> 00:27:41,488
Luke, come on. Labels.

314
00:27:42,238 --> 00:27:43,615
There is no confession.

315
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:45,617
There are no backroom deals.

316
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,869
I got myself into this,
I'm gonna get myself out of it.

317
00:27:48,078 --> 00:27:50,413
- You know that.
- I do, and that's what I told him.

318
00:27:50,664 --> 00:27:52,248
Well, there you have it.

319
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:54,668
Good luck in the courts, man.

320
00:27:57,337 --> 00:27:58,338
What about your daughter?

321
00:28:01,257 --> 00:28:04,594
You know, if you're not gonna do it for
your country, at least do it for your kid.

322
00:28:05,461 --> 00:28:07,329
Big mistake, kid.

323
00:28:08,932 --> 00:28:10,562
Hold on. Luke, Luke.

324
00:28:10,642 --> 00:28:12,352
He's still working from the manual.

325
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,437
I mean, he doesn't even
really know the rules.

326
00:28:15,313 --> 00:28:16,648
Now, come on, give him a break.

327
00:28:17,107 --> 00:28:18,942
Give me a break.

328
00:28:19,192 --> 00:28:20,193
Luke.

329
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:23,780
Appreciate it.

330
00:28:25,448 --> 00:28:26,866
It's good to see you, Nobody.

331
00:28:27,033 --> 00:28:28,159
You, too.

332
00:28:30,954 --> 00:28:32,288
Rule number one...

333
00:28:33,623 --> 00:28:34,833
Know your audience.

334
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,210
I gave you your shot. You shit the bed.

335
00:28:37,377 --> 00:28:39,295
Now I'm gonna show you how to get this done.

336
00:28:48,138 --> 00:28:50,015
You're dead, cop. Dead!

337
00:28:50,181 --> 00:28:52,559
I'm gonna slice some bacon
off your back, pig.

338
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:55,812
Well, well, well...

339
00:28:55,979 --> 00:28:59,733
Luke Hobbs behind bars.
Would you look at that.

340
00:29:00,734 --> 00:29:02,527
The bent cop got his day.

341
00:29:15,832 --> 00:29:17,208
You know, that color looks good on you.

342
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:19,586
Yeah, it'll look a whole hell of a lot
better with your blood on it.

343
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,588
Yeah, good luck with that, Hercules.

344
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,882
Lawman gone bad, huh?

345
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:26,176
Such a cliche.

346
00:29:27,177 --> 00:29:28,845
Oh, well, welcome to the club.

347
00:29:29,554 --> 00:29:31,348
I wouldn't get that twisted, son.

348
00:29:31,514 --> 00:29:33,516
We ain't in no club,
we got nothing in common.

349
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,268
And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.

350
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:36,644
What, you bring a shovel, did you?

351
00:29:37,228 --> 00:29:39,689
Because it's 38 feet of steel and concrete.

352
00:29:40,273 --> 00:29:41,483
Or so I've been told.

353
00:29:43,777 --> 00:29:45,028
Better get to digging.

354
00:29:46,404 --> 00:29:47,405
Wanker.

355
00:29:50,492 --> 00:29:51,576
Yeah.

356
00:30:08,885 --> 00:30:10,095
Move.

357
00:30:10,845 --> 00:30:12,305
Say that again.

358
00:30:12,931 --> 00:30:16,685
If I say it again, it'll be to a corpse.

359
00:30:19,979 --> 00:30:21,314
I'm gonna enjoy this.

360
00:30:21,815 --> 00:30:22,899
Welcome back, Dom.

361
00:30:23,358 --> 00:30:24,401
Nice job out there.

362
00:30:26,194 --> 00:30:27,612
You excited about tonight?

363
00:30:29,155 --> 00:30:30,156
You're going on this?

364
00:30:35,453 --> 00:30:36,746
You're with me, Dom.

365
00:30:46,715 --> 00:30:48,133
Showing me your shoe collection?

366
00:30:48,425 --> 00:30:49,426
Yep.

367
00:30:52,846 --> 00:30:54,639
A pair for every occasion.

368
00:30:54,806 --> 00:30:57,684
You have enough guns in here
to outfit a small army, huh?

369
00:30:57,851 --> 00:30:59,978
Oh, this is just the tip of the iceberg.

370
00:31:03,231 --> 00:31:06,234
You know what I like about you, Dom?
You're a genuine outlaw.

371
00:31:06,526 --> 00:31:08,987
I mean, you're a man
who lives by his own rules.

372
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,868
Which is surprising,
because when I saw you in Cuba,

373
00:31:11,948 --> 00:31:15,243
I heard about a guy who almost
killed you with a motorcycle,

374
00:31:15,452 --> 00:31:17,996
and you let him keep his car?

375
00:31:18,538 --> 00:31:20,123
Oh, that confused you?

376
00:31:20,498 --> 00:31:21,499
Hmm.

377
00:31:23,293 --> 00:31:25,211
'Course I could've taken his car.

378
00:31:25,879 --> 00:31:27,505
But it's about something bigger.

379
00:31:28,214 --> 00:31:29,632
This way...

380
00:31:31,426 --> 00:31:32,427
I changed him.

381
00:31:32,635 --> 00:31:34,137
That's not your responsibility.

382
00:31:34,387 --> 00:31:36,139
- But it's who I am.
- Is it?

383
00:31:36,723 --> 00:31:39,267
Let me ask you something, Dom.
What's the best thing in your life?

384
00:31:40,935 --> 00:31:42,604
- Family.
- No, it's not.

385
00:31:44,647 --> 00:31:46,191
Not if you're being honest.

386
00:31:47,025 --> 00:31:49,736
It's the 10 seconds between start and finish,

387
00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:51,654
when you're not thinking about anything.

388
00:31:51,988 --> 00:31:54,657
No family, no obligations.

389
00:31:54,824 --> 00:31:56,076
Just you.

390
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,161
Being free.

391
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,584
I gotta tell you,

392
00:32:04,668 --> 00:32:08,838
this whole saving-the-world, Robin Hood
nonsense you've been doing recently?

393
00:32:09,172 --> 00:32:11,591
It's bullshit. It's not you.

394
00:32:17,138 --> 00:32:18,765
Be who you are.

395
00:32:19,391 --> 00:32:21,393
Why live only a quarter mile at a time

396
00:32:21,476 --> 00:32:24,104
when you can live your whole life that way?

397
00:32:35,532 --> 00:32:36,616
Is that it?

398
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,703
Is that all those
bloated-out muscles will give ya?

399
00:32:40,203 --> 00:32:41,746
All show and no go.

400
00:32:55,844 --> 00:32:56,928
Oh, I got plenty of go.

401
00:32:57,303 --> 00:33:01,641
You must've misplaced that when I kicked
your arse up and down that office of yours.

402
00:33:01,725 --> 00:33:02,726
Yeah.

403
00:33:04,728 --> 00:33:06,855
Just like you Brits, rewriting history, huh?

404
00:33:07,063 --> 00:33:10,316
All I know is, it wasn't me that was
thrown out of a four-story window.

405
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,443
Jumped.

406
00:33:11,526 --> 00:33:14,404
I jumped out of a four-story window,
saving my partner's life.

407
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,616
'Cause where I'm from,
we don't settle fights by throwing bombs.

408
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,412
Well, that's funny, because where I'm from,
we don't need women to run to our rescue.

409
00:33:23,163 --> 00:33:25,999
I mean, do you really believe
you can stand in front of me

410
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,544
and beat me in a straight-up,
old-fashioned fist fight?

411
00:33:29,711 --> 00:33:30,920
Let me tell you something.

412
00:33:31,421 --> 00:33:35,258
Me and you, one-on-one, no one else around.

413
00:33:35,925 --> 00:33:40,055
I will beat your ass like a Cherokee drum.

414
00:33:43,016 --> 00:33:44,434
Maybe one day we'll find out.

415
00:33:44,934 --> 00:33:47,311
Oh, you better hope that day never comes.

416
00:33:56,738 --> 00:33:59,991
I said no, Mr. Nobody.
I'm not leaving this cell.

417
00:34:00,533 --> 00:34:02,385
I'll get out my way.

418
00:34:03,244 --> 00:34:04,245
The right way!

419
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:10,460
Hey! Why's the door open?
Get back in your cell!

420
00:34:10,543 --> 00:34:12,128
Relax. It's just a malfunction.

421
00:34:12,295 --> 00:34:14,530
- Get back!
- Just a malfunction.

422
00:34:26,309 --> 00:34:28,144
Stop him! Don't let him get away!

423
00:35:01,678 --> 00:35:02,804
Hobbs!

424
00:35:04,305 --> 00:35:06,141
I've been waiting a long time for this.

425
00:35:07,308 --> 00:35:08,518
Keep waiting, bitch.

426
00:35:13,815 --> 00:35:16,026
Rubber bullets. Big mistake.

427
00:36:38,149 --> 00:36:40,276
Well, that took longer than I expected.

428
00:36:42,487 --> 00:36:43,613
- Two questions.
- Yeah.

429
00:36:43,863 --> 00:36:45,782
- My daughter?
- With your sister.

430
00:36:46,616 --> 00:36:48,246
Toretto?

431
00:36:48,326 --> 00:36:50,036
It's interesting you ask.

432
00:36:50,996 --> 00:36:53,540
This is my new base. Welcome to nowhere.

433
00:36:54,124 --> 00:36:55,958
It's a little sterile for you.

434
00:36:56,668 --> 00:36:58,545
Listen, there's something
I wanna talk to you about after.

435
00:36:58,628 --> 00:37:00,005
Hey, listen, guys. Thanks...

436
00:37:00,088 --> 00:37:02,257
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What? Handcuffs? What is this?

437
00:37:02,465 --> 00:37:03,887
It's called abuse of power.

438
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:05,260
You told me to round them up.

439
00:37:05,468 --> 00:37:06,511
I didn't tell you to hand...

440
00:37:07,637 --> 00:37:09,889
Cut 'em loose. Oh, man. This is embarrassing.

441
00:37:10,348 --> 00:37:11,808
I'm sorry, guys, really, I...

442
00:37:12,642 --> 00:37:14,019
So, this is how you treat old friends?

443
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:17,647
Friends? We don't even really know
who the hell this guy is.

444
00:37:17,814 --> 00:37:19,858
Doesn't matter who I am, Tej.
I'm, like, nobody, okay?

445
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,359
Nobody. So, then, who is he?

446
00:37:21,526 --> 00:37:23,236
Him? He's nothing. He's, like, less than me.

447
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:26,322
Clearly, we're getting nowhere with nobody.

448
00:37:26,823 --> 00:37:29,326
I've been in here for four hours,
and my ribs are showing.

449
00:37:29,993 --> 00:37:32,162
I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.

450
00:37:33,663 --> 00:37:35,248
- I wouldn't recommend that.
- What?

451
00:37:35,332 --> 00:37:37,834
Well, thanks to your botched Berlin job,

452
00:37:37,917 --> 00:37:40,170
you all made Interpol's
Top 10 Most Wanted list.

453
00:37:40,337 --> 00:37:41,504
- Top 10.
- Mmm-hmm.

454
00:37:42,213 --> 00:37:43,214
That's all right.

455
00:37:43,298 --> 00:37:45,971
- Well, not you, Roman.
- What do you mean?

456
00:37:46,051 --> 00:37:48,428
You just missed the cut.
You're number 11, so...

457
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:50,597
- I'm... I missed?
- Yeah.

458
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:52,223
That's impossible!

459
00:37:52,932 --> 00:37:54,184
What number did they come in at?

460
00:37:55,352 --> 00:37:58,563
Six, eight, nine, ten.

461
00:37:59,689 --> 00:38:00,777
- She's 10?
- Mmm-hmm.

462
00:38:00,857 --> 00:38:02,984
That's impossible. There's no way she's a 10.

463
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:04,861
Oh, she's definitely a 10.

464
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,824
How about we focus on someone who
we're not gonna find on anybody's list.

465
00:38:09,991 --> 00:38:11,785
We're awaiting hard confirmation,

466
00:38:11,868 --> 00:38:15,705
but I believe that's the cyber
terrorist known as Cipher.

467
00:38:16,498 --> 00:38:19,709
Wait, no. Cipher's an organization.
Not a person.

468
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:21,044
Not according to our sources.

469
00:38:21,252 --> 00:38:22,337
What does she want?

470
00:38:22,462 --> 00:38:23,546
No one knows.

471
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,799
Cipher is like a digital act of God.

472
00:38:26,257 --> 00:38:30,261
They... Well, she can manipulate
world systems from the shadows.

473
00:38:30,345 --> 00:38:32,017
Anything that can be hacked
is hers to play with.

474
00:38:32,097 --> 00:38:35,725
And here's the kicker.
You'll never find her linked to any of it.

475
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:39,104
Her digital identity is scrubbed
every few seconds, worldwide.

476
00:38:39,187 --> 00:38:40,522
So, basically, she's the bogeyman.

477
00:38:40,689 --> 00:38:43,775
Damn, she's one of the hottest
bogeymans I've ever seen.

478
00:38:44,067 --> 00:38:47,336
I mean, if y'all know her,
tell her to get at your boy.

479
00:38:48,863 --> 00:38:50,740
- What are you, 12?
- That was my shin, mother...

480
00:38:50,907 --> 00:38:54,577
Let's just say, people are scared
of the hacker group Anonymous.

481
00:38:54,744 --> 00:38:56,166
But even Anonymous won't mess with her.

482
00:38:56,246 --> 00:38:58,665
What the hell does
any of this have to do with us?

483
00:38:58,748 --> 00:39:01,379
Probably nothing, Letty,
but I do find it interesting that,

484
00:39:01,459 --> 00:39:05,255
apparently, for some reason,
she's now working with this guy.

485
00:39:20,729 --> 00:39:24,357
He's already delivered a fully
operational EMP into her hands.

486
00:39:24,733 --> 00:39:28,611
Detonate that, they can turn any city
in the world into a war zone.

487
00:39:29,029 --> 00:39:31,489
So, then, what is it you're suggesting we do?

488
00:39:31,573 --> 00:39:32,741
Maybe we find Dom, huh?

489
00:39:32,907 --> 00:39:35,994
Well, first, let's catch him,
and then figure out why he's turned.

490
00:39:36,453 --> 00:39:39,164
So, y'all want us to track Dom.

491
00:39:39,331 --> 00:39:41,541
Yeah, I know, Roman, it's kind of a big job.

492
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,084
It's impossible.

493
00:39:43,251 --> 00:39:47,547
Which is why I'm bringing in
an extra pair of hands.

494
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,139
Ah, my day just got
a whole hell of a lot better.

495
00:39:56,306 --> 00:39:57,602
Mr. Nobody, you wanna tell me why

496
00:39:57,682 --> 00:40:02,145
you just put me in a room with this
tea-and-crumpets eating, criminal sumbitch?

497
00:40:02,228 --> 00:40:06,611
What a big mouth on a small head,
coming from Prisoner 6753.

498
00:40:06,691 --> 00:40:08,780
Don't think we've forgotten
everything that you've done.

499
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,283
We are not teaming up with this guy.

500
00:40:11,363 --> 00:40:13,948
Let's get one thing clear.
I ain't on your team.

501
00:40:14,407 --> 00:40:17,661
I don't care about you,
your crew, or your little family.

502
00:40:18,036 --> 00:40:19,124
I'm here for Cipher.

503
00:40:19,204 --> 00:40:21,039
What are you gonna do,
apply for a job? Head Asshole?

504
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:24,250
You know, I think that tight T-shirt's
cutting off the circulation to your brain.

505
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:25,585
You should get a bigger size.

506
00:40:26,294 --> 00:40:29,801
Cipher came to me first.
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.

507
00:40:29,881 --> 00:40:31,383
When I said no, she went after my brother.

508
00:40:31,466 --> 00:40:34,678
Ah, yes, brother Owen.
Who could forget him, huh?

509
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:37,809
Former hell-raiser and current guest

510
00:40:37,889 --> 00:40:40,475
at a nasty little black site prison.

511
00:40:40,892 --> 00:40:42,814
Cipher corrupted him and left him for dead.

512
00:40:42,894 --> 00:40:45,483
So, if I get a shot to take her down,
believe me, Flex, I'm taking it.

513
00:40:45,563 --> 00:40:47,485
You're taking my boot right up your ass,
is what you're taking.

514
00:40:47,565 --> 00:40:50,322
Guys, guys. The fastest way
to find Cipher is through Toretto.

515
00:40:50,402 --> 00:40:52,782
Now, aside from myself,
there's only two men in the world

516
00:40:52,862 --> 00:40:55,198
that have ever managed to actually
track him down with any success.

517
00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:58,163
And guess what. They're both
standing in front of me right now.

518
00:40:58,243 --> 00:41:01,246
So, like it or not,
you two are gonna work together.

519
00:41:02,247 --> 00:41:03,415
You got that?

520
00:41:06,334 --> 00:41:07,544
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

521
00:41:08,878 --> 00:41:10,338
Am I the only one seeing this?

522
00:41:11,131 --> 00:41:12,949
Oh, this ought to be good.

523
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:16,845
Use God's Eye.

524
00:41:17,429 --> 00:41:18,888
We put our lives on the line,

525
00:41:18,972 --> 00:41:21,808
running around the world
trying to figure this thing out.

526
00:41:21,891 --> 00:41:23,268
It can find anybody, right?

527
00:41:23,893 --> 00:41:25,395
Let's use it to find Dom.

528
00:41:25,729 --> 00:41:28,732
Roman, that is a great idea.

529
00:41:29,691 --> 00:41:32,110
Did you hear that? "Great idea."

530
00:41:32,527 --> 00:41:33,903
No, no, no, don't tune it out. Huh?

531
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,197
Mr. Nobody, let's fire it up, huh?

532
00:41:47,584 --> 00:41:49,252
Got him. He's in London.

533
00:41:51,504 --> 00:41:52,505
Yeah.

534
00:41:55,258 --> 00:41:58,595
Wait. We've got a second match in Hong Kong.

535
00:41:58,762 --> 00:42:01,306
Beijing and Seoul.

536
00:42:01,389 --> 00:42:02,891
And Tokyo.

537
00:42:04,517 --> 00:42:07,312
And just about every
other major city on the planet.

538
00:42:07,395 --> 00:42:10,899
And so, God's Eye was where we started.

539
00:42:11,024 --> 00:42:12,859
But Cipher's already created an evasion

540
00:42:12,942 --> 00:42:17,030
that masks their location by pinging
random spots all over the globe,

541
00:42:17,113 --> 00:42:18,698
but it was a good thought, Roman.

542
00:42:20,075 --> 00:42:21,701
So, she's made my program obsolete.

543
00:42:21,785 --> 00:42:24,120
And that, Ramsey, is why you're here.

544
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:27,123
See, simple solutions
aren't gonna cut it here, slick.

545
00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:30,919
Why you look at me when you say that?

546
00:42:31,336 --> 00:42:34,047
Wait a second. Wait, wait.
Simple solutions might just cut it.

547
00:42:34,464 --> 00:42:37,762
You see, in order for God's Eye
to give off all these false pings,

548
00:42:37,842 --> 00:42:39,761
means they have to be using a FLEA relay.

549
00:42:39,969 --> 00:42:41,012
Watch these two.

550
00:42:41,096 --> 00:42:43,181
Which means it has
a decaying sync randomizer.

551
00:42:43,264 --> 00:42:44,436
Which we can reverse...

552
00:42:44,516 --> 00:42:48,603
And track it back to the originating source
and find Dom's true location.

553
00:42:49,771 --> 00:42:51,064
I'm telling you, they got skills.

554
00:42:51,481 --> 00:42:52,691
That was my idea.

555
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:54,901
That's what I was saying. Remember in there?

556
00:42:54,984 --> 00:42:56,569
All right, let's try this.

557
00:43:07,163 --> 00:43:08,164
It's working.

558
00:43:08,623 --> 00:43:11,835
Time you wanna check your manual
and start organizing a force response.

559
00:43:12,836 --> 00:43:14,170
Let's get a hold of
our international assets...

560
00:43:14,254 --> 00:43:15,672
He's still green.

561
00:43:15,755 --> 00:43:17,590
Yeah, like fresh baby shit.

562
00:43:17,674 --> 00:43:20,260
As soon as we have Toretto's location,
I want to mobilize.

563
00:43:22,846 --> 00:43:25,473
Let's get a hold of a better asshole.

564
00:43:25,598 --> 00:43:27,767
No one respects you... Cover.

565
00:43:27,934 --> 00:43:28,935
Get away from me.

566
00:43:29,686 --> 00:43:30,895
All right, they're not in China.

567
00:43:32,355 --> 00:43:33,356
Or Russia.

568
00:43:34,816 --> 00:43:35,942
Europe's clear.

569
00:43:37,527 --> 00:43:39,279
But this one's not going away.

570
00:43:40,947 --> 00:43:41,990
This is interesting.

571
00:43:43,366 --> 00:43:44,367
Why?

572
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:47,579
Because that's here.

573
00:44:28,161 --> 00:44:29,666
Did you all enjoy that?

574
00:44:29,746 --> 00:44:32,082
Next-generation concussion grenade.

575
00:44:32,374 --> 00:44:37,462
It scrambles your senses.
Don't worry, it'll wear off in an hour.

576
00:44:38,045 --> 00:44:39,630
Probably.

577
00:44:39,798 --> 00:44:42,008
Hello, Deckard. Nice to see you again.

578
00:44:44,886 --> 00:44:47,722
Look at this, body's not even cold, Dom.

579
00:44:48,014 --> 00:44:50,266
Your family's already replacing you.

580
00:44:52,185 --> 00:44:54,104
You chose the losing team.

581
00:44:55,271 --> 00:44:57,857
I guess your brother is smarter than you.

582
00:45:31,891 --> 00:45:34,394
Smart move, embedding God's Eye
into the mainframe.

583
00:45:34,853 --> 00:45:38,148
Irritating to make me have to come
all the way down here to get it, but...

584
00:45:41,776 --> 00:45:42,902
Let's go.

585
00:45:49,659 --> 00:45:50,785
Dom!

586
00:45:59,836 --> 00:46:03,298
You're gonna turn your back
on family? Just like that?

587
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:40,293
Let's go.

588
00:47:13,576 --> 00:47:14,744
You okay?

589
00:47:18,248 --> 00:47:19,249
That wasn't him.

590
00:47:23,128 --> 00:47:27,716
I don't know what she's got on him,
but that wasn't Dom.

591
00:47:29,509 --> 00:47:30,847
Brian would know what to do.

592
00:47:30,927 --> 00:47:32,053
No!

593
00:47:35,974 --> 00:47:38,393
We can't bring Brian and Mia into this.

594
00:47:38,935 --> 00:47:40,353
We agreed on that.

595
00:47:42,814 --> 00:47:43,898
I know.

596
00:47:51,948 --> 00:47:56,619
Back there, was that for her, for me, or you?

597
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:00,040
And was it even necessary?

598
00:48:00,874 --> 00:48:02,876
Necessary?

599
00:48:03,043 --> 00:48:04,461
Nothing is necessary.

600
00:48:04,627 --> 00:48:06,796
Everything is a choice.

601
00:48:06,963 --> 00:48:09,299
And I simply made one. But so did you.

602
00:48:09,507 --> 00:48:11,634
You could've stopped me,
but you chose not to.

603
00:48:11,843 --> 00:48:14,012
I wonder what Letty thought about that.

604
00:48:16,556 --> 00:48:18,850
The problem with putting
your foot on a tiger's neck

605
00:48:19,017 --> 00:48:20,477
is you can never let it up.

606
00:48:20,977 --> 00:48:25,273
I think I need to remind you
why you chose to be here.

607
00:48:52,175 --> 00:48:53,343
Elena.

608
00:49:00,684 --> 00:49:01,810
Dom?

609
00:49:08,692 --> 00:49:10,193
I'm sorry.

610
00:49:12,862 --> 00:49:13,988
You shouldn't have come.

611
00:49:15,073 --> 00:49:17,200
Nothing could have kept me away.

612
00:49:17,367 --> 00:49:18,910
Now she has the three of us.

613
00:49:25,542 --> 00:49:27,335
Do you wanna see him?

614
00:49:31,589 --> 00:49:33,282
See Papa?

615
00:49:35,427 --> 00:49:36,845
See Papa.

616
00:49:40,724 --> 00:49:42,058
Papa.

617
00:49:52,068 --> 00:49:56,197
When I realized I was pregnant,
you had just found out Letty was alive.

618
00:49:58,116 --> 00:50:01,244
So I decided when Letty and you got
back from your honeymoon,

619
00:50:01,411 --> 00:50:03,246
I was going to tell you.

620
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:08,668
But then she took us before I had the chance.

621
00:50:13,757 --> 00:50:14,924
His name?

622
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:19,512
I call him Marcos.

623
00:50:21,056 --> 00:50:23,058
But that's his middle name.

624
00:50:24,225 --> 00:50:27,771
I thought his father
should give him his first name.

625
00:50:36,738 --> 00:50:38,782
I'm sorry, Dom.

626
00:50:39,908 --> 00:50:42,077
There's nothing to be sorry for.

627
00:50:44,871 --> 00:50:46,122
Whatever happens,

628
00:50:47,957 --> 00:50:49,918
just save our son.

629
00:50:53,797 --> 00:50:55,548
Your son.

630
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,071
Good visit?

631
00:51:20,323 --> 00:51:22,993
I know. I know what you're thinking.

632
00:51:24,661 --> 00:51:28,498
I just let the guards go, so there's
only two opponents in the room.

633
00:51:28,832 --> 00:51:31,835
Rhodes has the gun,
so you'll take him out first.

634
00:51:32,002 --> 00:51:33,128
I know you.

635
00:51:33,461 --> 00:51:36,631
And then you're thinking, Elena's a cop.

636
00:51:36,798 --> 00:51:40,010
Maybe the two of you
can fight your way out of here.

637
00:51:40,176 --> 00:51:42,845
So much to think about.

638
00:51:47,976 --> 00:51:49,853
Let me make it easier for you.

639
00:51:56,568 --> 00:51:58,445
Do with it as you wish.

640
00:52:06,494 --> 00:52:08,705
Have you heard of Choice Theory, Dom?

641
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:10,540
There is a bunch of axioms,

642
00:52:10,707 --> 00:52:13,376
but only two you really need
to concern yourself with.

643
00:52:13,543 --> 00:52:18,214
One, the only person's behavior
we can control is our own.

644
00:52:18,381 --> 00:52:22,635
And, two, the only thing we can truly give
another person is information.

645
00:52:22,802 --> 00:52:24,721
So, let me give you some.

646
00:52:25,805 --> 00:52:27,265
You see these cameras in here?

647
00:52:28,892 --> 00:52:31,811
The moment you make a move,
highly-paid men with weapons

648
00:52:31,978 --> 00:52:34,314
will make their way into this room

649
00:52:34,397 --> 00:52:36,941
with one very specific instruction.

650
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:39,277
It's not to save me.

651
00:52:40,945 --> 00:52:42,781
It's to kill your son.

652
00:52:44,074 --> 00:52:46,117
Now, that's a lot of bullets,

653
00:52:46,284 --> 00:52:48,953
and it only takes one
for you to lose everything.

654
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,748
So, I have to ask you,

655
00:52:51,915 --> 00:52:55,210
because I know family is so important to you.

656
00:52:57,962 --> 00:53:00,840
Is that really a choice you want to make?

657
00:53:04,386 --> 00:53:06,429
Because I'm ready if you are.

658
00:53:10,141 --> 00:53:13,269
If I pull this trigger,
and God knows I want to,

659
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:19,025
if I killed everyone on this plane,
I still couldn't get in there.

660
00:53:20,026 --> 00:53:22,862
'Cause of your two-man fail-safe system.

661
00:53:23,905 --> 00:53:25,573
Since I'm alone,

662
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:30,412
I got no choice!

663
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:41,339
I didn't think so.

664
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,456
You want to see the old Dom?

665
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:18,001
Watch.

666
00:54:27,385 --> 00:54:28,511
Bitch.

667
00:54:30,055 --> 00:54:32,015
- Don't, don't.
- Sweet dreams.

668
00:54:32,182 --> 00:54:33,350
Please!

669
00:54:37,103 --> 00:54:38,188
Damn it.

670
00:54:38,855 --> 00:54:41,066
She wiped it all. Took God's Eye.

671
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,569
That was the one thing
we could use to find them.

672
00:54:44,736 --> 00:54:46,029
We lost everything.

673
00:54:48,365 --> 00:54:49,366
What do you got, Princess?

674
00:54:50,617 --> 00:54:52,327
Finding Toretto.

675
00:54:52,786 --> 00:54:54,537
But I got a couple of minutes to spare,

676
00:54:54,704 --> 00:54:57,415
if you want me to send you
to the hospital. Again.

677
00:54:58,749 --> 00:55:01,461
- Yo, Rules.
- First off, that's not my name.

678
00:55:01,753 --> 00:55:03,630
- Little Nobody.
- Don't call me that.

679
00:55:03,797 --> 00:55:04,798
Oh, that's definitely sticking.

680
00:55:04,881 --> 00:55:08,013
Great. Do me a favor and tell Your Majesty
over there that we're gonna find Toretto.

681
00:55:08,093 --> 00:55:09,844
We find Toretto together as a team.

682
00:55:09,928 --> 00:55:11,137
And when this is all over with,

683
00:55:11,304 --> 00:55:13,682
I'm happy to slap that
whisker biscuit right off his face.

684
00:55:13,848 --> 00:55:16,059
Wait a minute, guys,
I think Deckard's actually onto something.

685
00:55:16,226 --> 00:55:19,854
How do you think Dom and Cipher
got into the country without us knowing?

686
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:21,773
Ghost flights.

687
00:55:21,898 --> 00:55:24,776
I thought untraceable aircraft
was all Internet conspiracy stuff.

688
00:55:24,859 --> 00:55:25,902
It's not.

689
00:55:26,027 --> 00:55:29,739
Satellites and radar grids
all across the globe

690
00:55:29,906 --> 00:55:31,991
shift like an ocean.

691
00:55:32,158 --> 00:55:34,285
They've got channels that open and close.

692
00:55:34,452 --> 00:55:37,414
And theoretically, if you know the right
people who know the right patterns...

693
00:55:37,831 --> 00:55:40,291
You can fly right through the blind
spots completely undetected.

694
00:55:41,084 --> 00:55:42,794
So you know where Dom is headed?

695
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:46,756
Yeah. New York.

696
00:55:49,092 --> 00:55:50,260
You see there, Luke?

697
00:55:50,427 --> 00:55:52,470
You guys are gonna get along just great.

698
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:56,433
Which proves rule number two,
you never lose everything.

699
00:55:56,599 --> 00:55:57,809
Fire up the chopper.

700
00:55:57,976 --> 00:56:00,437
Well, guys, have a ball in the Big Apple.

701
00:56:23,501 --> 00:56:25,545
And why are we traveling like this again?

702
00:56:25,712 --> 00:56:29,299
Because Dom took God's Eye,
so we need to stay off the grid.

703
00:56:29,674 --> 00:56:31,134
But like this?

704
00:56:35,305 --> 00:56:36,434
Look here, man.

705
00:56:36,514 --> 00:56:40,143
Before I throw up in my mouth,
let me ask you, what are we doing here?

706
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:41,853
That's a good question, Roman.

707
00:56:43,146 --> 00:56:44,397
Let me show you.

708
00:56:48,985 --> 00:56:51,529
Welcome to our new base of operations.

709
00:56:51,696 --> 00:56:54,824
No, seriously. What is this place?

710
00:56:54,991 --> 00:56:57,410
This is heaven.

711
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:06,586
It's the agency garage.
They call it the Toy Shop.

712
00:57:13,802 --> 00:57:15,640
This is where we house every vehicle

713
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,889
seized from drug dealers on the East Coast.

714
00:57:18,056 --> 00:57:22,143
Now, Mr. Nobody said that if we're
gonna have a chance at catching Dom,

715
00:57:23,561 --> 00:57:25,689
we're gonna have to be damn fast.

716
00:57:26,898 --> 00:57:28,566
Figured this would help.

717
00:57:31,778 --> 00:57:33,154
We got a tank.

718
00:57:33,321 --> 00:57:35,448
750 horsepower,

719
00:57:35,615 --> 00:57:39,452
6.6 liter, V8 Duramax engine

720
00:57:39,619 --> 00:57:43,581
with an M153 CROWS remotely
operated weapon station on top.

721
00:57:43,748 --> 00:57:46,042
You didn't get this from drug dealers.

722
00:57:46,209 --> 00:57:49,838
No. No, that, uh,
the United States Army lent me.

723
00:57:50,046 --> 00:57:53,383
See, the Army's developing machines like this
that soldiers can drive from a mile away,

724
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:56,094
so they can stay safe and alive.

725
00:57:56,261 --> 00:57:58,930
But, luckily, there's a backup driver's seat

726
00:57:59,097 --> 00:58:02,600
for those of us that like
to get more "hands on."

727
00:58:02,767 --> 00:58:04,519
I'm sitting here wondering this whole time,

728
00:58:04,686 --> 00:58:07,605
will this thing fit in valet
at Cheesecake Factory?

729
00:58:07,772 --> 00:58:10,150
No one is getting "hands on."

730
00:58:10,316 --> 00:58:12,610
She doesn't go on city streets.

731
00:58:15,905 --> 00:58:19,034
Wow. I'm in love.

732
00:58:21,202 --> 00:58:23,163
Again, no, no.

733
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:25,210
That's a million-dollar show car.

734
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:27,000
The point is to not draw attention.

735
00:58:27,167 --> 00:58:29,169
It's reverse psychology.

736
00:58:29,252 --> 00:58:30,587
Dom would never see it coming.

737
00:58:30,754 --> 00:58:32,047
It's neon orange.

738
00:58:32,213 --> 00:58:35,258
The International Space Station
would see it coming.

739
00:58:35,425 --> 00:58:37,886
Go choose anything less conspicuous.

740
00:58:38,053 --> 00:58:39,721
No, no, no. Calipers are my...

741
00:58:39,888 --> 00:58:41,017
- This is ridiculous.
- Not happening.

742
00:58:41,097 --> 00:58:42,599
Hey, my man,
you can put that down right there.

743
00:58:42,766 --> 00:58:46,478
This is a gift, a real gift.
I know what you're doing.

744
00:58:47,561 --> 00:58:50,565
I like your beard.
You're Blanta. Black Santa?

745
00:58:52,442 --> 00:58:54,986
No, I'm serious. Put it down right there.

746
00:59:22,138 --> 00:59:23,264
What are you doing?

747
00:59:23,431 --> 00:59:25,767
Engine's misfiring. I gotta check it out.

748
00:59:25,934 --> 00:59:27,560
No, that's not part of the plan, Dom.

749
00:59:27,727 --> 00:59:29,020
Clearly.

750
00:59:29,187 --> 00:59:31,731
But unless you want
the engine to seize on the job...

751
00:59:32,816 --> 00:59:34,234
You have five minutes.

752
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,952
Five minutes.

753
00:59:46,496 --> 00:59:47,706
I want another visual.

754
00:59:56,047 --> 00:59:57,298
I got an ATM.

755
01:00:09,227 --> 01:00:10,478
I don't like this.

756
01:00:24,284 --> 01:00:25,785
I want to see Toretto.

757
01:00:25,952 --> 01:00:27,746
- There are no more cameras.
- Then find something!

758
01:00:27,912 --> 01:00:29,247
Punch in on something reflective.

759
01:00:29,414 --> 01:00:31,333
A car mirror, anything.

760
01:00:41,426 --> 01:00:42,886
Do you know who I am?

761
01:00:43,053 --> 01:00:44,471
It's why I'm here.

762
01:00:45,221 --> 01:00:47,349
Do you know what I'm capable of?

763
01:00:48,975 --> 01:00:50,810
It's why I'm here.

764
01:00:51,728 --> 01:00:54,189
I'll give you until I finish me cuppa.

765
01:00:54,356 --> 01:00:56,149
And I'm fucking thirsty.

766
01:00:56,316 --> 01:00:59,903
I've got limited time,
so I won't take up too much of yours.

767
01:01:02,238 --> 01:01:05,533
No, you've already taken everything
I have of value, Mr. Toretto.

768
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:08,078
What more could you possibly want?

769
01:01:08,953 --> 01:01:10,622
To give you something back.

770
01:01:20,173 --> 01:01:21,257
Talk to me.

771
01:01:24,761 --> 01:01:26,471
Something's not right here.

772
01:01:27,597 --> 01:01:32,102
First time I saw my son
was behind a bulletproof glass.

773
01:01:33,353 --> 01:01:36,898
When he reached for me, I couldn't hold him.

774
01:01:38,316 --> 01:01:40,235
It's the worst pain I ever felt.

775
01:01:41,695 --> 01:01:44,406
I know you know exactly how that feels.

776
01:01:46,366 --> 01:01:48,451
Maybe we could change that.

777
01:01:49,411 --> 01:01:50,912
Now, why do I think

778
01:01:51,079 --> 01:01:55,625
you're about to suggest something
really dodgy, Mr. Toretto?

779
01:02:00,714 --> 01:02:02,674
It's why I'm here.

780
01:02:04,009 --> 01:02:07,512
Jesus, punch in on something.
I'm not liking this. Something's not right.

781
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:10,807
- Rhodes, you close?
- Yeah.

782
01:02:11,224 --> 01:02:12,225
Go.

783
01:02:12,392 --> 01:02:14,102
The delivery truck's moving.

784
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,405
I know.

785
01:02:46,384 --> 01:02:51,431
"Captain Deckard Shaw distinguished
himself by acts of gallantry

786
01:02:51,598 --> 01:02:54,684
"at the risk of his life above
and beyond the call of duty.

787
01:02:55,101 --> 01:02:59,439
"His bold actions saved the lives
of hostages and his teammates.

788
01:02:59,606 --> 01:03:02,692
"Recommendation: Victoria Cross."

789
01:03:03,068 --> 01:03:05,820
Highest honor the British
government has ever given

790
01:03:07,364 --> 01:03:08,740
to a traitor.

791
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:13,036
Something about this whole thing
that just doesn't add up to me.

792
01:03:13,203 --> 01:03:15,205
Well, that would be
the same kind of funny math

793
01:03:15,372 --> 01:03:19,668
that says a DSS agent who has
a Silver Star for valor stole an EMP.

794
01:03:19,834 --> 01:03:21,795
Sound familiar, huh?

795
01:03:28,968 --> 01:03:29,969
You want to give me a hand?

796
01:03:33,348 --> 01:03:34,349
- On three?
- Yeah.

797
01:03:34,516 --> 01:03:36,534
One, two, three.

798
01:03:39,979 --> 01:03:40,980
You know what, Twinkle Toes?

799
01:03:41,147 --> 01:03:43,483
In another life, I bet me and you
could've done some serious damage.

800
01:03:44,776 --> 01:03:46,236
- Yeah, we could've.
- Yeah.

801
01:03:47,779 --> 01:03:51,116
Shame I'm gonna have to bounce your head
off the fender when this is all over.

802
01:03:53,243 --> 01:03:55,453
Ah, well, with all due respect, Captain,

803
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:57,789
when this whole thing is over,
we're gonna find a location,

804
01:03:57,956 --> 01:03:59,708
and I'm gonna knock your teeth
so far down your throat,

805
01:03:59,874 --> 01:04:03,044
you're gonna stick a toothbrush
right up your ass to brush them.

806
01:04:10,135 --> 01:04:11,344
Give me God's Eye.

807
01:04:12,178 --> 01:04:13,221
God's Eye, active.

808
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:14,514
Good.

809
01:04:15,515 --> 01:04:17,100
Let's find us a Russian.

810
01:04:17,767 --> 01:04:20,061
I spy with my little eye,

811
01:04:20,478 --> 01:04:22,689
a Minister of Defense.

812
01:04:40,165 --> 01:04:42,417
We land back in Moscow by nine.

813
01:04:42,584 --> 01:04:44,586
Here's the latest defense report.

814
01:04:44,753 --> 01:04:46,880
All the items in yesterday's brief.

815
01:04:49,132 --> 01:04:50,884
Upload those coordinates to Dom's nav.

816
01:04:50,967 --> 01:04:52,093
Copy that.

817
01:05:15,367 --> 01:05:16,826
He's in the third car.

818
01:05:17,911 --> 01:05:20,371
It's a Guard Class limousine.

819
01:05:34,511 --> 01:05:35,553
Where's my team?

820
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,597
- Where's his team?
- There's no sign of them yet.

821
01:05:37,764 --> 01:05:39,349
They're off the grid.

822
01:05:39,432 --> 01:05:41,351
They're probably just
bunkered down somewhere.

823
01:05:41,434 --> 01:05:42,602
We're closing in on 'em.

824
01:05:44,479 --> 01:05:45,605
You guys ready?

825
01:05:45,772 --> 01:05:49,734
One thing I can guarantee,
Dom, no one's ready for this.

826
01:05:50,193 --> 01:05:53,196
I want every chip with a zero-day
exploit in a two-mile radius

827
01:05:53,363 --> 01:05:54,698
around that motorcade now.

828
01:05:54,864 --> 01:05:56,199
There's over a thousand of them.

829
01:05:56,533 --> 01:05:57,534
Hack 'em all.

830
01:06:15,176 --> 01:06:16,428
It's zombie time.

831
01:06:24,227 --> 01:06:25,979
I'd buckle up if I were you.

832
01:06:29,983 --> 01:06:31,192
What are you doing?

833
01:07:03,266 --> 01:07:04,601
Safety sensors overridden.

834
01:07:04,684 --> 01:07:05,769
Thank you.

835
01:07:28,792 --> 01:07:29,793
Hey!

836
01:07:38,051 --> 01:07:39,135
Target the motorcade.

837
01:07:49,479 --> 01:07:51,481
And here they come.

838
01:07:56,403 --> 01:07:57,487
What is going on?

839
01:08:02,492 --> 01:08:03,493
Drive!

840
01:08:09,416 --> 01:08:10,667
Police escort down.

841
01:08:11,042 --> 01:08:12,669
Take out the lead and follow cars.

842
01:08:28,977 --> 01:08:29,978
Drive! Drive!

843
01:08:39,946 --> 01:08:42,369
- Two more down.
- They're still under warranty.

844
01:08:42,449 --> 01:08:45,160
There's more ahead of us.
Shoot their engines!

845
01:08:53,376 --> 01:08:54,377
Oh, God!

846
01:09:08,391 --> 01:09:11,936
We got an army of cars driving themselves!
Send backup, send SWAT!

847
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:14,147
I don't care if you send
the goddamn Boy Scouts,

848
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:15,482
just send 'em some help!

849
01:09:15,565 --> 01:09:16,816
Now, that's Dom.

850
01:09:22,572 --> 01:09:23,573
Faster, faster!

851
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:47,180
The motorcade just turned on Seventh.

852
01:09:47,263 --> 01:09:48,848
Perfect. Make it rain.

853
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,401
Oh, God!

854
01:10:47,824 --> 01:10:48,825
Target immobilized.

855
01:10:50,243 --> 01:10:51,369
You're up, Dom.

856
01:11:05,759 --> 01:11:07,135
What the hell is that?

857
01:11:07,302 --> 01:11:08,345
What's he doing?

858
01:11:11,765 --> 01:11:12,766
What are you waiting for?

859
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,642
Shoot him!

860
01:11:15,143 --> 01:11:16,561
Come on, come on!

861
01:11:25,779 --> 01:11:26,780
I'm out.

862
01:11:28,573 --> 01:11:29,616
Shit.

863
01:11:29,699 --> 01:11:30,662
Don't worry, sir.

864
01:11:30,742 --> 01:11:32,035
The car is impenetrable.

865
01:11:32,285 --> 01:11:33,370
You'll be safe in here.

866
01:11:37,874 --> 01:11:39,084
Give me the case.

867
01:11:39,167 --> 01:11:40,130
Give him the case!

868
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:41,961
Those are nuclear launch codes.

869
01:11:42,212 --> 01:11:44,214
We cannot give it to him.

870
01:11:49,386 --> 01:11:50,387
What is he doing?

871
01:12:07,862 --> 01:12:09,239
He just cut a hole in our gas tank!

872
01:12:36,599 --> 01:12:37,934
Good work, Dom.

873
01:12:38,893 --> 01:12:40,020
Meet you at the pickup.

874
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:52,157
I think I know where my team's at.

875
01:12:52,699 --> 01:12:54,451
- Where?
- Right in front of me.

876
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:08,423
This is on you.

877
01:13:09,174 --> 01:13:10,592
Get out of there, Dom.

878
01:13:10,884 --> 01:13:12,344
Guys, I know why Dom's here.

879
01:13:12,927 --> 01:13:15,680
Police scanners are saying
he stole a nuclear football.

880
01:13:19,059 --> 01:13:22,345
It's over, Toretto.
Get your ass outta the car now.

881
01:13:29,319 --> 01:13:30,820
So, that's how you wanna play this?

882
01:13:31,738 --> 01:13:32,989
Let's play.

883
01:13:38,912 --> 01:13:40,705
Don't do this, Dom.

884
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,085
He's going for it!

885
01:13:46,002 --> 01:13:47,295
- What are you doing?
- It's a trap!

886
01:13:50,048 --> 01:13:51,091
Damn it!

887
01:14:12,654 --> 01:14:15,198
Now I know what it feels like
to be every cop ever chasing us!

888
01:14:15,365 --> 01:14:16,866
I'm gonna get a little closer.
I'm gonna PIT him.

889
01:14:17,033 --> 01:14:18,868
Oh, so, you just gonna PIT Dom?

890
01:14:18,994 --> 01:14:21,997
Little Nobody has clearly
lost his little mind.

891
01:14:34,551 --> 01:14:35,593
I'm on him.

892
01:14:35,677 --> 01:14:37,053
Easy. Work together.

893
01:14:46,896 --> 01:14:47,897
Wait, wait, wait!

894
01:14:49,733 --> 01:14:50,900
Oh, sh...

895
01:14:57,657 --> 01:14:58,742
I'll take the shortcut!

896
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:14,049
Look out! Watch those people!

897
01:15:14,924 --> 01:15:16,384
Big Sexy comin' through!

898
01:15:46,122 --> 01:15:47,332
Not this time, Dom.

899
01:16:18,488 --> 01:16:20,990
Watch the drag or the line will snap!

900
01:16:46,683 --> 01:16:48,351
Stretch him out! Hold him!

901
01:17:16,713 --> 01:17:19,049
He's gotta have about
2,000 horsepower in that thing.

902
01:17:19,466 --> 01:17:20,467
Try 3,000!

903
01:17:24,679 --> 01:17:25,847
Try five.

904
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:35,231
Get out of there.

905
01:17:35,398 --> 01:17:36,441
I'm working on it.

906
01:17:36,524 --> 01:17:38,401
Stop working on it and do it.

907
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:52,624
No, no, no, this my Bentley!

908
01:18:03,259 --> 01:18:04,969
No! No!

909
01:18:32,539 --> 01:18:34,541
Get that case and run.

910
01:18:46,886 --> 01:18:48,096
Move.

911
01:18:54,185 --> 01:18:56,146
They thought this was
gonna be a street fight.

912
01:18:56,521 --> 01:18:57,647
What are you waiting for, Toretto?

913
01:19:00,734 --> 01:19:01,901
No!

914
01:19:14,706 --> 01:19:15,790
Letty, stop!

915
01:19:20,837 --> 01:19:21,838
What are you gonna do?

916
01:19:35,018 --> 01:19:38,938
I don't know why you're doing this,
but I know one thing.

917
01:19:40,482 --> 01:19:41,524
You love me.

918
01:19:46,196 --> 01:19:48,114
And you are not gonna shoot me.

919
01:19:59,709 --> 01:20:03,004
You should've given him the case,
'cause I won't chase you.

920
01:20:05,298 --> 01:20:06,508
Okay.

921
01:20:07,217 --> 01:20:09,094
I will just take it from a dead girl.

922
01:20:11,054 --> 01:20:12,555
You willing to die for it?

923
01:20:30,907 --> 01:20:32,033
Let's go, then.

924
01:20:53,763 --> 01:20:54,764
Anything?

925
01:20:55,765 --> 01:20:56,933
They're gone.

926
01:20:58,351 --> 01:21:00,437
And DOD confirmed it was a nuclear football.

927
01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:03,273
He's got an EMP and nuclear launch codes.

928
01:21:04,733 --> 01:21:08,236
I don't know what it is,
but they're building towards something.

929
01:21:08,653 --> 01:21:09,738
Deckard?

930
01:21:11,281 --> 01:21:12,365
He didn't make it.

931
01:21:33,970 --> 01:21:35,347
I'm disappointed in you, Dom.

932
01:21:36,389 --> 01:21:39,809
When push came to shove, you were gonna
let Letty just walk away with the codes.

933
01:21:39,893 --> 01:21:41,019
You got the codes!

934
01:21:41,102 --> 01:21:42,645
Rhodes got the codes.

935
01:21:43,229 --> 01:21:45,648
You made the choice to let her go.

936
01:21:47,484 --> 01:21:49,486
And now I have to make one of my own.

937
01:22:01,665 --> 01:22:05,335
They are adorable little things, aren't they?

938
01:22:06,127 --> 01:22:07,921
God, I hope I don't hurt him.

939
01:22:12,676 --> 01:22:15,345
Look, psychotic, I did exactly
what you asked me to do.

940
01:22:16,471 --> 01:22:17,597
Don't do this.

941
01:22:17,972 --> 01:22:19,349
This is your doing.

942
01:22:19,683 --> 01:22:20,684
My doing?

943
01:22:25,355 --> 01:22:26,856
Da-dada.

944
01:22:27,023 --> 01:22:28,274
Dada.

945
01:22:28,692 --> 01:22:29,901
Da-da.

946
01:22:30,485 --> 01:22:32,237
Please don't hurt him, I'm begging you.

947
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,698
I don't want you to beg.

948
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,660
I want you to learn.

949
01:22:39,035 --> 01:22:40,370
Learn what?

950
01:22:41,663 --> 01:22:45,333
I understand why you did
what you did. I really do.

951
01:22:48,003 --> 01:22:49,129
Da-da.

952
01:22:51,881 --> 01:22:53,842
But it was the wrong choice.

953
01:22:54,718 --> 01:22:57,220
This is the consequence of that.

954
01:22:58,972 --> 01:22:59,973
No!

955
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:01,891
No! No!

956
01:23:02,058 --> 01:23:03,309
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

957
01:23:04,644 --> 01:23:06,271
Save your son!

958
01:23:06,688 --> 01:23:07,731
No!

959
01:23:34,924 --> 01:23:37,427
Can you pull up the footage
from the guy in the alley?

960
01:23:38,136 --> 01:23:39,220
Traffic cams.

961
01:23:39,387 --> 01:23:40,388
I got you.

962
01:23:44,934 --> 01:23:45,977
I knew it.

963
01:23:46,436 --> 01:23:47,729
I recognize that guy.

964
01:23:48,688 --> 01:23:49,939
That's Connor Rhodes.

965
01:23:50,357 --> 01:23:53,026
I met him when I was working
with Shaw's brother.

966
01:23:53,109 --> 01:23:55,403
He wanted us to get
the Nightshade device for him.

967
01:23:55,820 --> 01:23:57,030
Connor Rhodes.

968
01:23:57,864 --> 01:24:00,245
He's also linked to somebody
I'd quite like to forget.

969
01:24:00,325 --> 01:24:01,826
It's Mose Jakande.

970
01:24:02,535 --> 01:24:04,496
Warlord who tried to get God's Eye.

971
01:24:04,579 --> 01:24:07,248
Which means that's twice that Dom
has messed up Cipher's business.

972
01:24:21,054 --> 01:24:25,558
Everything you're feeling right now,
this rage, a sense of loss, it's not real.

973
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:30,897
It's a survival instinct
wired deep into our brains

974
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:33,650
to ensure continuation of the species.

975
01:24:34,859 --> 01:24:38,321
When early man would visit a watering hole,

976
01:24:38,405 --> 01:24:40,323
if they didn't watch their child,

977
01:24:40,407 --> 01:24:42,826
and it got snatched by a crocodile,

978
01:24:43,868 --> 01:24:49,874
our brains would create
a painful but instructional memory,

979
01:24:51,334 --> 01:24:53,086
so it would never happen again.

980
01:24:55,338 --> 01:24:58,425
This idea of "family"
that is so core with you,

981
01:24:58,591 --> 01:25:00,343
that rules your world,

982
01:25:02,345 --> 01:25:03,930
it's a biological lie.

983
01:25:05,682 --> 01:25:07,392
You don't have to accept it.

984
01:25:09,853 --> 01:25:10,895
I don't.

985
01:25:13,857 --> 01:25:16,860
Did you really think you
could destroy two of my teams

986
01:25:16,943 --> 01:25:18,695
without any repercussions?

987
01:25:19,904 --> 01:25:22,699
I wouldn't have even looked
your way if you hadn't done that.

988
01:25:23,324 --> 01:25:25,327
You didn't even know you had a kid.

989
01:25:26,745 --> 01:25:30,248
You can thank me for that and start
doing the job I'm asking you to do.

990
01:25:30,415 --> 01:25:31,833
Help you start a war.

991
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,835
Is that what you think I want?

992
01:25:36,546 --> 01:25:37,797
That's so limited.

993
01:25:39,549 --> 01:25:41,426
I didn't take that football to start a war

994
01:25:41,509 --> 01:25:44,220
any more than I took
your son to start a family.

995
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:47,057
Taking your son got me the codes.

996
01:25:47,515 --> 01:25:49,688
The codes will get me the nukes

997
01:25:49,768 --> 01:25:52,145
and the nukes will get me what I want

998
01:25:52,228 --> 01:25:56,733
today, tomorrow, and every day after that.

999
01:25:56,941 --> 01:25:58,401
And what's that?

1000
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:01,821
Accountability.

1001
01:26:04,282 --> 01:26:06,493
The second I fire off one of those nukes,

1002
01:26:06,576 --> 01:26:09,954
I put the superpowers
of this world on notice that,

1003
01:26:10,038 --> 01:26:11,581
when they cross the line,

1004
01:26:14,084 --> 01:26:16,586
I'm gonna be there to hold them responsible.

1005
01:26:18,421 --> 01:26:20,382
Because the truth is, Dom,

1006
01:26:20,924 --> 01:26:22,467
to the world out there,

1007
01:26:25,428 --> 01:26:28,014
I am the crocodile at the watering hole.

1008
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:36,314
We've got one last job to do.

1009
01:26:38,191 --> 01:26:39,442
Cipher.

1010
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:50,286
If I were you, I'd kiss my son.

1011
01:26:54,207 --> 01:26:57,919
Because whether
you value it or not, all of this,

1012
01:26:58,712 --> 01:27:02,090
your plane, your security, and you,

1013
01:27:03,091 --> 01:27:05,135
are still on this earth because of him.

1014
01:27:10,974 --> 01:27:13,730
The problem we've had with tracking
Cipher is there's nothing to trace.

1015
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:15,273
But now, we have Rhodes' information.

1016
01:27:15,353 --> 01:27:19,024
And we're getting snapshots of his data
before it's scrubbed off the net.

1017
01:27:19,107 --> 01:27:21,780
That looks like somebody's bank account,
so why don't we just go ahead...

1018
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:23,028
It's a longitude.

1019
01:27:23,737 --> 01:27:25,989
Given the fact that Dom
hit a Russian motorcade,

1020
01:27:26,072 --> 01:27:28,324
it's safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead and bring up the map.

1021
01:27:29,617 --> 01:27:31,578
Good. Let's start here
and run the possibilities.

1022
01:27:32,329 --> 01:27:34,998
Yalta, Poltava...

1023
01:27:35,081 --> 01:27:36,499
It's like they just threw letters together.

1024
01:27:36,833 --> 01:27:37,876
Kronyurt.

1025
01:27:37,959 --> 01:27:39,169
It's "Vladovin."

1026
01:27:39,377 --> 01:27:40,920
- What are you doing here?
- What?

1027
01:27:41,087 --> 01:27:43,969
Told you I was gonna check in on you from
time to time to see how you were doin'.

1028
01:27:44,049 --> 01:27:45,508
By the way, not so hot.

1029
01:27:46,134 --> 01:27:48,720
But there's nothing in Vladovin.
It's just ice.

1030
01:27:48,803 --> 01:27:49,971
That's funny.

1031
01:27:50,263 --> 01:27:52,182
Could've sworn there was
a secret Russian naval base

1032
01:27:52,265 --> 01:27:54,184
where they retrofitted Cold War submarines.

1033
01:27:54,267 --> 01:27:56,561
Well, technically, it's not Russian anymore.

1034
01:27:57,187 --> 01:27:58,188
The base was taken over

1035
01:27:58,271 --> 01:28:00,565
by a terror group of military
separatists about a month ago,

1036
01:28:00,648 --> 01:28:02,279
and the Russians haven't taken it back yet,

1037
01:28:02,359 --> 01:28:04,611
so there is a little window
of opportunity here.

1038
01:28:04,861 --> 01:28:07,197
Russian submarines. Nuclear football.

1039
01:28:07,364 --> 01:28:10,575
It sounds like everything we do,
our legs gonna be blown off.

1040
01:28:10,742 --> 01:28:13,995
It sounds like you still
number 11 on the list.

1041
01:28:14,537 --> 01:28:16,081
It sounds like you've changed

1042
01:28:16,164 --> 01:28:18,583
since your little punk-ass
facial hairs done came in.

1043
01:28:18,708 --> 01:28:19,793
Guys, guys.

1044
01:28:19,876 --> 01:28:22,212
Hey, we gotta call this in.
All the way up the chain.

1045
01:28:22,295 --> 01:28:25,090
That's good thinking, champ,
except unfortunately,

1046
01:28:25,173 --> 01:28:27,217
the Russian Minister of Defense

1047
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:30,053
got himself involved in a little
incident on US territory,

1048
01:28:30,136 --> 01:28:32,263
and the two governments aren't talking
to each other for a while.

1049
01:28:32,347 --> 01:28:33,973
By the time they do, it'll be too late.

1050
01:28:34,057 --> 01:28:35,850
So, any other suggestions?

1051
01:28:36,685 --> 01:28:38,728
Yeah. I got one.

1052
01:28:39,604 --> 01:28:41,439
How about we just stop them ourselves?

1053
01:28:41,523 --> 01:28:43,400
You're talking about a Russian military base.

1054
01:28:43,483 --> 01:28:44,651
Separatist.

1055
01:28:44,734 --> 01:28:45,819
Whatever. It's suicide.

1056
01:28:45,902 --> 01:28:47,362
It's stopping World War III.

1057
01:28:49,489 --> 01:28:50,573
What's it gonna be, rook?

1058
01:28:51,074 --> 01:28:53,159
You gonna close your eyes on this one, too?

1059
01:28:53,326 --> 01:28:56,287
Pray that the apocalypse doesn't come
knocking on your mama's front door?

1060
01:28:56,997 --> 01:28:59,332
Or, are you gonna saddle up, be a man,

1061
01:28:59,416 --> 01:29:01,918
and save the entire goddamn world?

1062
01:29:07,924 --> 01:29:10,385
You know, I think I figured it out.

1063
01:29:10,677 --> 01:29:11,803
What's that?

1064
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:13,847
- Rule number three.
- Which is?

1065
01:29:15,348 --> 01:29:16,433
There are no rules.

1066
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:21,938
What'd I tell you, Luke?
I knew he'd get it in three.

1067
01:29:22,105 --> 01:29:23,648
Aerial transport leaves in an hour.

1068
01:29:23,732 --> 01:29:26,276
Take whatever vehicle you want.
All bets are off.

1069
01:29:26,484 --> 01:29:28,194
- All bets are off?
- Bets are off?

1070
01:29:28,278 --> 01:29:29,612
Do svidanya!

1071
01:29:55,472 --> 01:29:57,140
Letty, I don't like telling you this one bit.

1072
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:59,100
But the game's changed.

1073
01:29:59,642 --> 01:30:02,479
Before, we were just trying to catch Dom,
but now, after all this,

1074
01:30:02,729 --> 01:30:04,481
I want you to know, if I have to,

1075
01:30:05,982 --> 01:30:07,108
I'm gonna put him down.

1076
01:30:10,153 --> 01:30:11,738
Then you might have to take us both down.

1077
01:30:13,490 --> 01:30:14,783
I'm freezing, man.

1078
01:30:15,241 --> 01:30:16,913
This ain't for me.

1079
01:30:16,993 --> 01:30:19,537
I come from a different
kind of lifestyle, brah.

1080
01:30:21,706 --> 01:30:25,168
Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with it.

1081
01:30:26,378 --> 01:30:30,340
I tried to take a piss,
I didn't even recognize myself.

1082
01:30:30,757 --> 01:30:33,009
Man, that's entirely too much information.

1083
01:30:33,176 --> 01:30:34,260
I'm just sayin'.

1084
01:30:34,427 --> 01:30:36,096
Well, one thing's for sure.

1085
01:30:37,013 --> 01:30:39,477
Dom's gotta be either working
with them or making a trade,

1086
01:30:39,557 --> 01:30:41,017
because no one would be this insane

1087
01:30:41,101 --> 01:30:42,686
to hit this place without a damn army.

1088
01:30:43,853 --> 01:30:46,022
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

1089
01:30:47,482 --> 01:30:48,692
Speak of the devil.

1090
01:30:56,700 --> 01:31:00,036
All right, Dom, you're one step
closer to that family reunion.

1091
01:31:00,203 --> 01:31:01,371
400 meters to base.

1092
01:31:01,538 --> 01:31:03,873
Prep the EMP. Let's take these defenses down.

1093
01:31:15,635 --> 01:31:16,886
We have a possible threat approaching.

1094
01:31:17,512 --> 01:31:20,932
Raise the barricade.

1095
01:31:37,407 --> 01:31:39,409
We've lost power, defensive positions now.

1096
01:31:41,537 --> 01:31:44,247
Gates are open. Let's get this party started.

1097
01:32:00,263 --> 01:32:01,890
- EMP is recharging.
- How long?

1098
01:32:02,223 --> 01:32:03,433
Sixty seconds.

1099
01:32:04,309 --> 01:32:06,853
All right, Dom, you have
one pulse left in that EMP.

1100
01:32:07,354 --> 01:32:08,980
That sub is heavily insulated.

1101
01:32:09,147 --> 01:32:11,316
You're gonna need to be right
underneath it for this thing to work.

1102
01:32:35,674 --> 01:32:37,133
Come on.

1103
01:32:37,217 --> 01:32:39,219
Engaging target. He's beneath the sub.

1104
01:32:45,433 --> 01:32:47,894
Mayday! Mayday! I've lost all power.
I'm going down.

1105
01:32:54,651 --> 01:32:55,652
Yes!

1106
01:32:55,819 --> 01:32:57,320
Two birds with one stone.

1107
01:32:57,487 --> 01:32:58,822
We've got control of the sub.

1108
01:32:58,905 --> 01:33:01,574
Dom, we are good.
Head over to the rendezvous.

1109
01:33:01,658 --> 01:33:04,744
Okay, Matty, let's take this baby for a spin.

1110
01:33:10,417 --> 01:33:11,584
Damn!

1111
01:33:11,751 --> 01:33:14,337
I think Cipher just rebooted that
sub to slave its command system.

1112
01:33:14,671 --> 01:33:16,047
What the hell is he talking about?

1113
01:33:16,297 --> 01:33:19,843
In layman's terms,
she just carjacked a submarine.

1114
01:33:21,386 --> 01:33:22,971
We can't let it get away.

1115
01:33:23,722 --> 01:33:25,056
There's the control room.

1116
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:27,559
If you can get me into that wheelhouse,

1117
01:33:27,642 --> 01:33:29,606
I can tap the network
and counter-hack Cipher.

1118
01:33:29,686 --> 01:33:31,316
Keep it from lowering into the water.

1119
01:33:31,396 --> 01:33:33,273
No, what we need to do is get me on that sub.

1120
01:33:33,523 --> 01:33:35,525
I find the weapons room
and I can pull the launch chip

1121
01:33:35,608 --> 01:33:37,027
before she can fire any of those nukes.

1122
01:33:37,193 --> 01:33:38,278
That is too crazy.

1123
01:33:38,445 --> 01:33:39,738
What you're saying is too dangerous.

1124
01:33:39,821 --> 01:33:40,864
We'll do both.

1125
01:34:05,263 --> 01:34:06,264
Knock, knock.

1126
01:34:11,353 --> 01:34:13,646
Five vehicles just breached the base.

1127
01:34:13,813 --> 01:34:15,482
They just don't give up, do they?

1128
01:34:24,532 --> 01:34:27,118
All right, let's haul ass, team.
Double time, double time!

1129
01:34:34,793 --> 01:34:36,169
Letty, let's roll!

1130
01:34:38,546 --> 01:34:39,964
Go! Go, go, go!

1131
01:35:16,209 --> 01:35:17,252
Change of plans, Dom.

1132
01:35:17,544 --> 01:35:19,629
I'm sending you new coordinates.
Head there immediately.

1133
01:35:20,005 --> 01:35:21,548
I'm done. I want my son.

1134
01:35:21,631 --> 01:35:22,799
I'll tell you when you're done.

1135
01:35:23,174 --> 01:35:24,509
Your team is in play.

1136
01:35:24,592 --> 01:35:26,970
Now, meet Rhodes and follow my instruction.

1137
01:35:32,392 --> 01:35:34,019
I've got you covered! Go!

1138
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:39,482
Move, move! Get outta here! Go, go, go!

1139
01:35:47,407 --> 01:35:49,492
Okay. How do you like this?

1140
01:35:52,787 --> 01:35:55,373
- Remote link has been severed.
- I'll take care of this.

1141
01:35:59,294 --> 01:36:00,628
Hi, Ramsey.

1142
01:36:04,507 --> 01:36:05,759
She's regained control.

1143
01:36:05,925 --> 01:36:07,177
Damn it. She's good.

1144
01:36:48,593 --> 01:36:49,806
They're entering the weapons room.

1145
01:36:49,886 --> 01:36:50,929
Oh, that's cute.

1146
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:58,687
Pull! Pull!

1147
01:36:59,062 --> 01:37:01,398
Roman, Roman! We gotta find the chip, go!

1148
01:37:04,943 --> 01:37:06,152
Oh, she's slick.

1149
01:37:06,403 --> 01:37:07,904
Gonna have to do better than that, though.

1150
01:37:09,989 --> 01:37:11,908
Okay, now you're starting to piss me off.

1151
01:37:27,132 --> 01:37:29,217
Ramsey, how much time we talkin' here?

1152
01:37:29,676 --> 01:37:32,721
You're smart, but not smart enough.

1153
01:37:36,224 --> 01:37:37,225
She's locked me out.

1154
01:37:41,271 --> 01:37:43,693
Tej, I can't stop her.
You're gonna have to pull that chip.

1155
01:37:43,773 --> 01:37:45,904
I can't! This thing's gone into attack mode!

1156
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:48,111
The door's not gonna open
until you pull the chip!

1157
01:37:49,154 --> 01:37:51,948
Tej, we got no idea
what the hell we're looking for.

1158
01:37:53,324 --> 01:37:54,326
I got it!

1159
01:37:57,287 --> 01:37:59,748
What in the hell are you guys doin'?

1160
01:38:00,749 --> 01:38:02,792
It wasn't me. It wasn't me, okay?

1161
01:38:02,876 --> 01:38:04,461
It'll be labeled "Guidance Go."

1162
01:38:04,669 --> 01:38:06,504
- Guidance Go, Guidance Go...
- Okay, I got somethin'.

1163
01:38:06,588 --> 01:38:07,964
- What?
- It says...

1164
01:38:14,095 --> 01:38:15,221
Do you understand that?

1165
01:38:40,246 --> 01:38:41,706
Wow. Nasty.

1166
01:38:55,345 --> 01:38:56,680
Quite a show.

1167
01:38:59,766 --> 01:39:00,767
We're arming the nuke.

1168
01:39:03,728 --> 01:39:05,397
(POWERING UP)

1169
01:39:06,147 --> 01:39:08,608
Nuke's going hot!
She's tryin' to fire this thing!

1170
01:39:08,692 --> 01:39:10,822
Roger that. We're moving out.
(OVER RADIO) Disable the nukes!

1171
01:39:10,902 --> 01:39:12,529
Roman, what are you seeing?
Come on, talk to me.

1172
01:39:12,654 --> 01:39:14,280
I don't see shit. I'm holding on!

1173
01:39:16,157 --> 01:39:17,409
And we have a countdown.

1174
01:39:21,037 --> 01:39:22,747
What the hell is goin' on, man?

1175
01:39:22,831 --> 01:39:25,875
We're about to launch a nuclear missile,
is what the hell is goin' on!

1176
01:39:25,959 --> 01:39:27,002
Pull the damn chip!

1177
01:39:30,422 --> 01:39:32,799
Countdown, countdown! Look for a countdown!

1178
01:39:32,882 --> 01:39:33,925
What countdown?

1179
01:39:34,009 --> 01:39:35,635
The missiles need to activate to launch.

1180
01:39:35,719 --> 01:39:37,387
The countdown timer won't be in Russian.

1181
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:38,680
The countdown...

1182
01:39:39,222 --> 01:39:41,391
Let's show the world what we've got.

1183
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:44,227
No, no, no! Don't press that!

1184
01:39:46,730 --> 01:39:47,731
I got it.

1185
01:39:49,899 --> 01:39:51,735
Something's wrong. It won't launch.

1186
01:39:53,445 --> 01:39:55,947
Get that sub outta there. Now!

1187
01:39:58,533 --> 01:40:00,076
Move your ass, Roman!

1188
01:40:08,043 --> 01:40:09,127
You all right?

1189
01:40:09,210 --> 01:40:10,754
There's nothing all right about any of this!

1190
01:40:11,212 --> 01:40:13,131
- Let's go!
- What about the missiles?

1191
01:40:14,382 --> 01:40:16,388
We got the chip. No nukes for her.

1192
01:40:16,468 --> 01:40:18,595
Hell, yeah. Let's roll.

1193
01:40:22,724 --> 01:40:25,268
Guys, we got company. A lot of company!

1194
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:31,358
All right, team, here's the plan.

1195
01:40:31,524 --> 01:40:33,276
There's a sea lock at the opening of the bay.

1196
01:40:33,485 --> 01:40:34,611
We get there first and close it,

1197
01:40:34,694 --> 01:40:37,614
we can stop the submarine
from escaping into open water

1198
01:40:37,739 --> 01:40:39,157
and disappearing forever.

1199
01:40:41,034 --> 01:40:43,787
I've got the location.
It's 10 miles southwest.

1200
01:40:44,037 --> 01:40:46,498
Ten miles?
We're not gonna make it ten seconds!

1201
01:40:54,005 --> 01:40:56,466
No, no, no! This is not good!

1202
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:59,719
What's the matter, Roman?
Forgot your snow tires?

1203
01:41:00,011 --> 01:41:01,429
Whoa!

1204
01:41:01,638 --> 01:41:03,223
You lovin' that Lambo now?

1205
01:41:03,598 --> 01:41:05,433
Whoa! Ah!

1206
01:41:13,316 --> 01:41:14,651
All right, everyone.

1207
01:41:14,734 --> 01:41:15,985
We'll deal with that launch chip later.

1208
01:41:16,069 --> 01:41:18,783
Right now, I want that sub
in deep water where no one can find it.

1209
01:41:18,863 --> 01:41:20,490
Find me the fastest route out of that bay.

1210
01:41:20,573 --> 01:41:21,574
Copy that.

1211
01:41:31,251 --> 01:41:32,669
Why are they shootin' at me?

1212
01:41:32,752 --> 01:41:34,966
Maybe 'cause you're in an orange
Lamborghini, I don't know.

1213
01:41:35,046 --> 01:41:36,840
Shut up, Tej!

1214
01:41:42,178 --> 01:41:43,513
Dom...

1215
01:41:43,596 --> 01:41:45,348
Do you really wanna put that car in gear?

1216
01:41:46,933 --> 01:41:47,934
Do it.

1217
01:41:48,309 --> 01:41:49,310
Huh?

1218
01:41:52,022 --> 01:41:53,443
I didn't think so.

1219
01:41:53,523 --> 01:41:54,819
They're heading for the sea lock.

1220
01:41:54,899 --> 01:41:56,154
They're trying to trap the sub in the bay.

1221
01:41:56,234 --> 01:41:59,157
I should have taken care
of this a long time ago.

1222
01:41:59,237 --> 01:42:01,698
Rhodes, take his team out.

1223
01:42:02,532 --> 01:42:03,742
I'm on it.

1224
01:42:09,456 --> 01:42:10,707
Roman, get in front of me!

1225
01:42:17,547 --> 01:42:19,257
Okay, y'all wanna play rough?

1226
01:42:20,433 --> 01:42:22,234
Now it's my turn.

1227
01:42:36,182 --> 01:42:37,759
Yeah, baby!

1228
01:42:46,409 --> 01:42:48,703
Guys, we got snowmobiles on the right.

1229
01:42:50,872 --> 01:42:52,248
They're gonna flank us!

1230
01:42:56,419 --> 01:42:57,420
No, they ain't!

1231
01:43:03,426 --> 01:43:04,636
Oh, shit!

1232
01:43:19,025 --> 01:43:20,026
Tej!

1233
01:43:20,151 --> 01:43:21,903
Roman, hold tight, I'm on the way!

1234
01:43:26,408 --> 01:43:28,493
I don't wanna go swimmin'! No!

1235
01:43:34,582 --> 01:43:35,792
Really, Tej?

1236
01:43:39,295 --> 01:43:40,672
Oh, no, no, no!

1237
01:43:44,676 --> 01:43:45,760
Oh, shit!

1238
01:43:48,513 --> 01:43:49,726
Roman, grab your door!

1239
01:43:49,806 --> 01:43:50,890
Tej!

1240
01:43:51,141 --> 01:43:52,437
Grab the door, Roman!

1241
01:43:52,517 --> 01:43:53,518
- It's so cold!
- Shit!

1242
01:43:54,144 --> 01:43:55,145
Oh, shit!

1243
01:44:01,943 --> 01:44:03,153
Whoa!

1244
01:44:03,570 --> 01:44:04,779
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

1245
01:44:05,488 --> 01:44:07,118
What is going on?

1246
01:44:07,198 --> 01:44:08,283
Roman, hang on!

1247
01:44:09,826 --> 01:44:10,827
Tej!

1248
01:44:14,539 --> 01:44:16,124
Get me off of this thing!

1249
01:44:16,499 --> 01:44:17,834
Tej!

1250
01:44:21,338 --> 01:44:22,339
Come on!

1251
01:44:32,223 --> 01:44:33,600
Argh!

1252
01:44:37,354 --> 01:44:39,689
All right. I've had enough of this shit!

1253
01:44:53,912 --> 01:44:55,538
Number 11, my ass!

1254
01:44:58,208 --> 01:45:00,877
Yo, shrinkage! We got a sub to catch. Get in!

1255
01:45:14,724 --> 01:45:15,725
What?

1256
01:45:15,809 --> 01:45:17,060
Depressurization alert in the cargo hold.

1257
01:45:17,268 --> 01:45:18,895
Drop it to 10,000 feet.

1258
01:45:19,729 --> 01:45:22,107
I know how much these people mean to you.

1259
01:45:22,190 --> 01:45:24,275
So I will let you pick the first target.

1260
01:45:24,359 --> 01:45:26,069
I don't pick a target from a mile away.

1261
01:45:27,904 --> 01:45:30,407
I stand face to face
and look 'em dead in the eye.

1262
01:45:32,575 --> 01:45:33,952
Okay.

1263
01:45:34,235 --> 01:45:36,245
The wife it is.

1264
01:45:53,388 --> 01:45:56,349
Nice plane. I'm gonna enjoy having this.

1265
01:45:57,142 --> 01:45:58,476
Hey, don't go gettin' any ideas.

1266
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,145
You and planes don't have a good history.

1267
01:46:02,647 --> 01:46:04,149
No shit.

1268
01:46:04,232 --> 01:46:06,943
Okay, let's go, Scarface.

1269
01:46:07,610 --> 01:46:09,112
These assholes ain't gonna kill themselves.

1270
01:46:12,824 --> 01:46:14,617
Pull up surveillance right now.

1271
01:46:19,748 --> 01:46:21,124
Surprise.

1272
01:46:22,751 --> 01:46:24,753
You're supposed to be dead.

1273
01:46:35,096 --> 01:46:36,059
You're driving.

1274
01:46:36,139 --> 01:46:37,602
- I said from the beginning...
- No way.

1275
01:46:37,682 --> 01:46:39,309
- I am not going to drive.
- I'm not driving.

1276
01:46:40,977 --> 01:46:44,481
We have a security breach in
the cargo hold. Take care of it now.

1277
01:46:49,986 --> 01:46:52,906
Jesus, Mum.
You're supposed to avoid the nerves.

1278
01:46:52,989 --> 01:46:54,491
Oh, shut up. Don't be such a baby.

1279
01:47:00,914 --> 01:47:01,915
Get to the pilot.

1280
01:47:01,998 --> 01:47:03,667
He's got the second key. Wait for my signal.

1281
01:47:04,334 --> 01:47:05,669
Give Cipher my regards.

1282
01:47:06,795 --> 01:47:08,505
Did Toretto hold up his end of the deal?

1283
01:47:20,225 --> 01:47:22,394
He gave us this little thing here.

1284
01:47:22,686 --> 01:47:24,688
No, no, no. Don't touch.

1285
01:47:25,313 --> 01:47:26,564
You can track Cipher with this,

1286
01:47:26,648 --> 01:47:29,613
but you can't do this on your own.
There's gotta be two of ya.

1287
01:47:29,693 --> 01:47:31,695
Fine. I've got contacts.

1288
01:47:32,821 --> 01:47:34,280
No, you're gonna take your brother.

1289
01:47:34,364 --> 01:47:35,573
- Oh, dear...
- Yes.

1290
01:47:39,703 --> 01:47:41,746
Toretto knows where he is.

1291
01:47:41,830 --> 01:47:43,415
He's got this thing. It can see everything.

1292
01:47:43,498 --> 01:47:45,875
It's like... It's called
the Devil's Bum Hole or something.

1293
01:47:45,959 --> 01:47:47,043
It's called the God's Eye.

1294
01:47:47,127 --> 01:47:48,211
Yeah, well, whatever.

1295
01:47:50,714 --> 01:47:53,303
There's no way I'm using Owen, all right?

1296
01:47:53,383 --> 01:47:55,093
He's a lost cause.

1297
01:47:55,176 --> 01:47:58,221
He's your brother, Decks. He's my son.

1298
01:47:58,722 --> 01:48:00,181
He's our family.

1299
01:48:01,057 --> 01:48:04,310
And our family don't die in bloody cages.

1300
01:48:04,686 --> 01:48:07,814
How can you talk like that about Owen?
I can't believe you.

1301
01:48:07,897 --> 01:48:10,987
You've gone and upset me.
You've really upset your mother.

1302
01:48:11,067 --> 01:48:12,318
Call yourself a brother? You're...

1303
01:48:12,402 --> 01:48:14,696
Look, come here... Mum. Okay, okay.

1304
01:48:16,823 --> 01:48:18,742
Every time.

1305
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:23,621
Owen.

1306
01:48:23,997 --> 01:48:25,206
In position.

1307
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:27,751
Go.

1308
01:48:29,336 --> 01:48:30,803
I'm in.

1309
01:48:49,064 --> 01:48:50,231
I've got the package, Toretto.

1310
01:48:51,274 --> 01:48:52,942
All 12 pounds of him.

1311
01:48:53,318 --> 01:48:54,694
Ah.

1312
01:48:54,778 --> 01:48:58,114
Dada. Dada.

1313
01:49:13,797 --> 01:49:15,715
You made me miss my shot.

1314
01:49:15,799 --> 01:49:17,634
What you think you're doing?

1315
01:49:20,095 --> 01:49:21,471
Looking at you dead in the eye.

1316
01:49:44,744 --> 01:49:46,663
That was for Elena.

1317
01:49:50,333 --> 01:49:51,334
Rhodes.

1318
01:49:51,501 --> 01:49:53,169
He's no longer with us.

1319
01:49:54,170 --> 01:49:55,755
Rhodes picked the wrong target.

1320
01:49:57,132 --> 01:50:00,927
Congratulations, Dom.
You just killed your son.

1321
01:50:01,011 --> 01:50:03,847
You're wrong. I just saved him.

1322
01:50:04,639 --> 01:50:06,850
And you just took your foot
off the tiger's neck.

1323
01:50:15,358 --> 01:50:18,194
All right, governor, it's gonna get noisy.

1324
01:50:19,362 --> 01:50:20,989
This is for your ears.

1325
01:50:25,952 --> 01:50:26,953
Good?

1326
01:50:29,914 --> 01:50:30,999
Let's go.

1327
01:50:33,376 --> 01:50:36,546
No! Stop him!
Do not let him get off this plane!

1328
01:50:39,382 --> 01:50:40,925
We got another problem.

1329
01:50:41,009 --> 01:50:42,719
That truck's got
enough missiles to take us all out.

1330
01:50:42,969 --> 01:50:44,095
Then don't give 'em a target.

1331
01:50:44,179 --> 01:50:46,476
Everybody, get in front of us,
line up, and we'll take the hit.

1332
01:50:46,556 --> 01:50:49,476
What? I need to switch cars right now!

1333
01:51:01,529 --> 01:51:02,864
Target acquired.

1334
01:51:05,784 --> 01:51:07,952
- Roman, here comes the bad part.
- What?

1335
01:51:14,709 --> 01:51:16,961
Hang in there, guys.
We're almost to the lock.

1336
01:51:17,045 --> 01:51:19,923
It's easy for you to say
when your ass ain't on fire.

1337
01:51:25,428 --> 01:51:29,099
All right, little man,
this might be a little scary,

1338
01:51:29,516 --> 01:51:30,934
but it's gonna be a lot of fun.

1339
01:51:42,404 --> 01:51:43,408
How's the music, good?

1340
01:51:43,488 --> 01:51:44,489
Ah.

1341
01:51:57,043 --> 01:51:58,294
They're locking on.

1342
01:51:58,378 --> 01:51:59,838
Sorry, guys, I got no tricks left.

1343
01:51:59,921 --> 01:52:00,884
What do we do now?

1344
01:52:00,964 --> 01:52:02,424
We start prayin'!

1345
01:52:24,988 --> 01:52:25,989
Hell, yeah!

1346
01:52:38,752 --> 01:52:40,003
There's Dom!

1347
01:52:43,882 --> 01:52:45,383
What, is this guy on our side now?

1348
01:52:45,467 --> 01:52:47,344
Who the hell cares? He just saved our ass!

1349
01:52:51,014 --> 01:52:52,891
Good to be riding with you again, man.

1350
01:53:06,279 --> 01:53:07,781
Toretto just cleared the way for them.

1351
01:53:07,864 --> 01:53:09,327
Someone, give me something!

1352
01:53:09,407 --> 01:53:10,450
Torpedoes are ready.

1353
01:53:10,533 --> 01:53:11,576
Then launch them!

1354
01:53:25,090 --> 01:53:26,091
Shit.

1355
01:53:29,844 --> 01:53:31,638
- Take the wheel!
- I ain't takin' shit!

1356
01:53:31,721 --> 01:53:33,139
Take the wheel!

1357
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:34,641
Where you goin'?

1358
01:53:36,393 --> 01:53:37,647
This is crazy!

1359
01:53:37,727 --> 01:53:38,937
Speed up!

1360
01:53:42,107 --> 01:53:43,653
- Left and back!
- What?

1361
01:53:43,733 --> 01:53:45,985
Turn the goddamn wheel
to the left really quickly!

1362
01:53:52,993 --> 01:53:54,160
Boom, baby!

1363
01:54:01,001 --> 01:54:02,085
Goin' for a ride.

1364
01:54:07,590 --> 01:54:08,591
Back in a sec.

1365
01:54:23,898 --> 01:54:25,275
- Where's that smile?
- Ah.

1366
01:54:25,358 --> 01:54:26,526
There it is.

1367
01:54:32,323 --> 01:54:33,491
You were gonna shoot a baby?

1368
01:54:34,784 --> 01:54:36,911
You sick bastard.

1369
01:54:37,871 --> 01:54:39,039
You're not gonna wanna see this.

1370
01:54:52,427 --> 01:54:53,470
Is that you or him?

1371
01:54:56,431 --> 01:54:58,224
Him. Good.

1372
01:54:58,558 --> 01:54:59,851
The torpedoes missed.

1373
01:54:59,934 --> 01:55:01,686
They're gonna reach the lock
before the sub does.

1374
01:55:01,770 --> 01:55:02,979
The hell they are.

1375
01:55:05,732 --> 01:55:07,067
Get ready for this.

1376
01:55:27,337 --> 01:55:28,338
Oh, shit!

1377
01:55:28,421 --> 01:55:29,756
We're gonna need a bigger truck.

1378
01:55:41,226 --> 01:55:42,894
It's right under us! Get out the way!

1379
01:55:55,156 --> 01:55:56,241
Get us out of here!

1380
01:55:56,408 --> 01:55:57,951
Why are you always yelling?

1381
01:56:01,913 --> 01:56:03,206
This bitch is crazy!

1382
01:56:03,289 --> 01:56:04,666
Look out!

1383
01:56:10,797 --> 01:56:11,881
That's not good.

1384
01:56:13,341 --> 01:56:14,884
That's not good.

1385
01:56:18,638 --> 01:56:20,557
Please tell me there's nothing
to worry about!

1386
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:22,058
We got this.

1387
01:56:34,696 --> 01:56:35,947
That's my girl.

1388
01:56:42,495 --> 01:56:45,168
The sub's too close.
We ain't making it to the gate in time.

1389
01:56:45,248 --> 01:56:46,458
We're just going to let it get away?

1390
01:56:46,791 --> 01:56:48,251
Not if I know Dom.

1391
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:54,632
You lose, Dom.

1392
01:56:54,716 --> 01:56:57,052
I destroyed two of your teams.

1393
01:56:57,302 --> 01:56:59,596
I killed your red-headed boyfriend.

1394
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:02,807
And I put two killers
on your untraceable plane.

1395
01:57:03,975 --> 01:57:06,728
You lost the minute
you interrupted my honeymoon.

1396
01:57:07,604 --> 01:57:09,439
Now guess who I'm coming for.

1397
01:57:10,023 --> 01:57:12,025
Put a heatseeker on him now.

1398
01:57:14,027 --> 01:57:15,153
Now!

1399
01:57:20,492 --> 01:57:21,493
Fire!

1400
01:57:25,830 --> 01:57:28,083
That's a goddamn heatseeker coming at us!

1401
01:57:30,835 --> 01:57:33,213
Peel off! Head to the shore!

1402
01:57:39,386 --> 01:57:42,138
All right. Come and get it.

1403
01:58:00,073 --> 01:58:01,199
No, no, no.

1404
01:58:03,076 --> 01:58:05,203
Dive! Dive!

1405
01:58:05,829 --> 01:58:07,038
This...

1406
01:58:07,205 --> 01:58:08,873
This is for my son.

1407
01:58:28,184 --> 01:58:29,185
Dom!

1408
01:59:31,873 --> 01:59:33,211
You're out of bullets, Deckard.

1409
01:59:33,291 --> 01:59:35,919
Not like I'm gonna need a gun
to take care of you.

1410
01:59:37,295 --> 01:59:38,797
How did you find me?

1411
01:59:40,882 --> 01:59:42,258
You want to see the old Dom?

1412
01:59:43,635 --> 01:59:44,844
Watch.

1413
01:59:47,931 --> 01:59:49,391
Resourceful.

1414
01:59:49,933 --> 01:59:52,102
You have a lot to answer for, Cipher.

1415
01:59:52,686 --> 01:59:54,521
What you've put my family through.

1416
01:59:54,938 --> 01:59:56,398
My mother.

1417
01:59:57,774 --> 02:00:00,151
I'm gonna make sure that never happens again.

1418
02:00:00,860 --> 02:00:01,945
To anyone.

1419
02:00:02,696 --> 02:00:05,035
There is only one flaw in your plan.

1420
02:00:05,115 --> 02:00:06,157
What's that?

1421
02:00:06,241 --> 02:00:08,535
Only one of us has a parachute.

1422
02:00:31,141 --> 02:00:32,642
Told you this would be fun.

1423
02:00:36,479 --> 02:00:37,814
Time to land, boys.

1424
02:00:48,408 --> 02:00:49,993
You know I never left you, Letty.

1425
02:00:50,076 --> 02:00:51,328
I know.

1426
02:00:51,745 --> 02:00:53,997
And you know I never will.

1427
02:00:55,498 --> 02:00:56,875
I know.

1428
02:01:06,843 --> 02:01:08,720
I have so much to tell you.

1429
02:01:09,387 --> 02:01:13,391
Yeah, you do.
And you can start with that bitch.

1430
02:01:17,729 --> 02:01:21,024
Now, that's Dominic Toretto.

1431
02:01:23,109 --> 02:01:24,110
Hey, Dom!

1432
02:01:24,194 --> 02:01:28,285
I'm just throwin' it out there,
we need to get up outta here

1433
02:01:28,365 --> 02:01:31,621
'cause there's all kinda nuclearism
happening under this ice.

1434
02:01:31,701 --> 02:01:35,038
Relax. Without the trigger chips,
those nukes are harmless.

1435
02:01:35,413 --> 02:01:37,165
Okay. So we good, then.

1436
02:01:37,457 --> 02:01:40,377
Let me go on and get
my young selfie levels up.

1437
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:42,879
You realize this is classified, right?

1438
02:01:42,962 --> 02:01:44,339
Not today.

1439
02:01:46,466 --> 02:01:47,512
Unbelievable.

1440
02:01:47,592 --> 02:01:50,095
All right, can we get up
outta here, now? I'm freezin'!

1441
02:02:17,956 --> 02:02:19,124
It's okay.

1442
02:02:19,916 --> 02:02:22,043
Don't worry. He's gonna be here soon.

1443
02:02:22,419 --> 02:02:24,170
I get it. Y'all got a lot in common.

1444
02:02:24,254 --> 02:02:27,218
Computer hacks, God's Eye,
geeks, nerd... You know.

1445
02:02:27,298 --> 02:02:28,925
But we got a lot in common, too, right?

1446
02:02:29,009 --> 02:02:30,180
Like what?

1447
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:33,638
We walk in the room
and we're oozin' sex appeal.

1448
02:02:33,722 --> 02:02:35,974
Me and you, hip to hip, is a problem.

1449
02:02:36,057 --> 02:02:38,476
I'm askin' a real question right now.

1450
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:41,813
Is it gonna be Revenge of the Nerds

1451
02:02:42,605 --> 02:02:46,276
or The Dark Knight? Huh?

1452
02:02:46,609 --> 02:02:48,611
To be honest, I like both of you.

1453
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:54,659
But just before we get into all of that,

1454
02:02:54,743 --> 02:02:56,536
let me ask you one question.

1455
02:02:56,619 --> 02:02:58,496
You can ask me anything.

1456
02:02:58,580 --> 02:02:59,706
Anything.

1457
02:02:59,789 --> 02:03:01,124
What's my last name?

1458
02:03:04,002 --> 02:03:07,425
When you guys figure it out,
then, I guess you can let me know.

1459
02:03:07,505 --> 02:03:10,175
It's gonna be Parker.
That's all that really matters.

1460
02:03:10,258 --> 02:03:11,593
- Jones.
- Mrs. Parker.

1461
02:03:12,010 --> 02:03:13,970
- Right?
- Hey, Mrs. Parker...

1462
02:03:14,512 --> 02:03:15,513
Hey.

1463
02:03:15,597 --> 02:03:16,890
Letty.

1464
02:03:16,973 --> 02:03:18,475
I wanted to thank you.

1465
02:03:19,017 --> 02:03:20,018
No need.

1466
02:03:21,269 --> 02:03:22,270
Well...

1467
02:03:22,604 --> 02:03:25,277
Cipher's still on the loose.
There's been some reports she's in Athens,

1468
02:03:25,357 --> 02:03:27,779
but she won't be nuking
any cities anytime soon.

1469
02:03:27,859 --> 02:03:29,069
Thanks to you guys.

1470
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:31,279
So, I got you a party favor.

1471
02:03:31,521 --> 02:03:32,906
This can't be good.

1472
02:03:32,989 --> 02:03:35,492
Your record's been cleared.
Full reinstatement.

1473
02:03:35,575 --> 02:03:37,122
You've got your job back.

1474
02:03:37,202 --> 02:03:38,703
That is, if you want it.

1475
02:03:42,123 --> 02:03:43,253
If I want?

1476
02:03:43,333 --> 02:03:44,334
Mmm-hmm.

1477
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:55,011
You know, after 16 years,
I figure it's time for a little break.

1478
02:03:55,637 --> 02:03:56,805
Wow.

1479
02:03:58,390 --> 02:04:00,350
Daddy's stayin' home.

1480
02:04:06,856 --> 02:04:07,899
Nobody.

1481
02:04:07,982 --> 02:04:09,025
Keep in touch.

1482
02:04:09,484 --> 02:04:11,069
Ah. Hang on a second.

1483
02:04:11,403 --> 02:04:13,571
This could be interesting.

1484
02:04:18,693 --> 02:04:19,861
What made you think I'd do it?

1485
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:22,125
Brotherhood.

1486
02:04:22,205 --> 02:04:25,834
I saw that look you gave Cipher,
knew you wanted revenge.

1487
02:04:26,167 --> 02:04:27,669
Glad I did it.

1488
02:04:31,006 --> 02:04:33,508
I can't believe you went to see my mother.

1489
02:04:48,815 --> 02:04:50,817
All this fuss over you.

1490
02:04:56,823 --> 02:04:58,241
Yes.

1491
02:05:03,330 --> 02:05:06,416
Elena, I promised to keep our son safe.

1492
02:05:08,585 --> 02:05:10,754
And now, he always will be.

1493
02:05:18,887 --> 02:05:23,183
I wanna introduce you to the most
important person in my universe.

1494
02:05:24,851 --> 02:05:27,270
One who never gave up on me.

1495
02:05:32,942 --> 02:05:34,027
He's beautiful.

1496
02:05:35,779 --> 02:05:40,116
You've heard me say that you
never turn your back on family,

1497
02:05:42,077 --> 02:05:46,122
and I wanna thank you all
for never turning your back on me.

1498
02:05:50,710 --> 02:05:52,295
You wanna meet them?

1499
02:05:52,962 --> 02:05:54,464
All right.

1500
02:05:55,298 --> 02:05:56,633
Everyone,

1501
02:05:57,967 --> 02:05:59,386
meet Brian.

1502
02:06:08,645 --> 02:06:09,896
To Brian!

1503
02:06:09,979 --> 02:06:11,856
Welcome to the family, Brian.

1504
02:06:11,940 --> 02:06:14,651
Okay, I guess it's my turn to say grace.

1505
02:06:15,110 --> 02:06:17,616
We thank you for giving us family.

1506
02:06:17,696 --> 02:06:22,075
We sit here in praise.
Thank you for giving us the strength...
