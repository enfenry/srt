1
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,160
That's the cleanup crew

2
00:00:43,193 --> 00:00:45,161
up on the track,
and that's a lot of racers

3
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:47,964
involved there, folks.

4
00:01:01,143 --> 00:01:04,213
Jack, you realize
you got this in the bag, right?

5
00:01:04,247 --> 00:01:06,359
Season's wrapped up, man.
Doesn't matter where you place.

6
00:01:06,383 --> 00:01:07,726
I'm telling you,
I got intermittent miss.

7
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,985
- Last two laps.
- On it!

8
00:01:09,018 --> 00:01:10,219
Get those plug wires!

9
00:01:10,252 --> 00:01:11,988
Jakob! Now.

10
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,524
Hey, pop.

11
00:01:14,557 --> 00:01:16,092
Tell me what you see, Dom.

12
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,402
Got an oil spill
going into turn two.

13
00:01:17,426 --> 00:01:19,229
Bell's driving safe.

14
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:21,040
Corbin's got a sponsor in
the stands, so he's pushing it.

15
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:22,298
Talking about me?

16
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,000
You got a real problem
with car 23.

17
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:26,470
- Linder.
- About to whip your ass, Toretto!

18
00:01:26,502 --> 00:01:28,338
- Settle down, pretty boy!
- That's right.

19
00:01:28,372 --> 00:01:30,249
- Shut up!
- Yeah, you. You want to tell your driver

20
00:01:30,273 --> 00:01:31,650
- he's gonna get somebody hurt?
- What'd you say?

21
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,019
- Hey! Leave it!
- Go home! You suck!

22
00:01:33,043 --> 00:01:34,411
He's just pissed I got that spot

23
00:01:34,443 --> 00:01:36,113
in the Busch series
next season, not him.

24
00:01:36,145 --> 00:01:38,648
Life's got no shortage of guys
like Kenny Linder.

25
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,083
You're good!

26
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:45,455
It's not about being
the stronger man, Dom.

27
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:47,557
It's about being the bigger one.

28
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:18,254
I swear to God, this guy.

29
00:02:25,529 --> 00:02:27,465
Pop, turn two, turn two!

30
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,070
Got it. I'm walking him in.

31
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:40,311
Shit!

32
00:02:50,287 --> 00:02:51,622
Tell me what you see, Dom.

33
00:02:57,526 --> 00:02:59,429
He's gonna come at you for that.

34
00:03:06,502 --> 00:03:07,603
Get ready on your left.

35
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:02,800
Dad!

36
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,387
He's gone! He's gone!

37
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,593
We got to get him out of there.

38
00:04:07,626 --> 00:04:09,400
We got to get him out of there!
That's my dad!

39
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,600
That's my dad!

40
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,400
That's my dad! That's my dad!

41
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:18,052
That's my dad!

42
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:20,654
Get him out of there!

43
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:22,023
That's my dad!

44
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,221
There's a couple of release
forms we've got to sign.

45
00:04:40,253 --> 00:04:42,290
Few clearances.

46
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:48,795
Everything else is down there
around the corner.

47
00:05:14,288 --> 00:05:16,223
Hey.

48
00:05:16,255 --> 00:05:19,292
Nobody's supposed to be
around here.

49
00:05:19,326 --> 00:05:21,729
You Toretto's other son?

50
00:05:21,762 --> 00:05:23,731
You're the useless one, right?

51
00:05:30,403 --> 00:05:31,571
What is that?

52
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:34,842
Get out of here. Go.

53
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,311
So a man can't pay
his last respects?

54
00:05:37,343 --> 00:05:38,711
That's what that is?

55
00:05:38,744 --> 00:05:39,847
No.

56
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,381
No, not you.

57
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:42,624
You're the one that killed him.

58
00:05:42,648 --> 00:05:44,551
No, racing killed him.

59
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:46,296
Look, he knew that I was gonna
pit him into the wall.

60
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,821
He knew that.

61
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:49,464
Now, I don't know if
he dropped gear. I don't know.

62
00:05:49,488 --> 00:05:51,691
I swear... I swear to God,

63
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:53,761
- if you don't get out of here...
- What? What?

64
00:05:53,793 --> 00:05:54,961
Go find Buddy.

65
00:05:54,994 --> 00:05:56,796
Now!

66
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:05,338
All right, well,
now we got the golden boy.

67
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:10,477
Leave.

68
00:06:11,445 --> 00:06:13,280
You here to make threats, too?

69
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:15,850
"Leave" is a simple word.

70
00:06:16,882 --> 00:06:18,484
Man, what is it
with you Torettos

71
00:06:18,517 --> 00:06:20,720
where you're all the heroes
in your own stories?

72
00:06:20,753 --> 00:06:23,490
Look, I'm gonna
tell you a secret.

73
00:06:23,523 --> 00:06:26,894
You, your dad, me...
We're all stuck,

74
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:30,296
going round and round
in the same shitty circle.

75
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,399
And we ain't never getting out.

76
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,670
You ain't half the man
my dad was.

77
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:40,641
- At least I'm alive, asshole.
- What did you say?

78
00:06:40,674 --> 00:06:42,542
Get off me!

79
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:43,944
Dom! Dom!

80
00:06:43,976 --> 00:06:46,280
Dom!

81
00:06:46,312 --> 00:06:48,248
Dom, no! Dom!

82
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,750
No, man!

83
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,345
It's all gonna be okay, Jakob.

84
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,150
We got some rough times ahead...

85
00:07:32,353 --> 00:07:34,422
but it's gonna be okay.

86
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,326
'Cause we're family.

87
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,910
Yo, what do you think?

88
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:54,180
<i>¿Es una ilusión o es real?</i>

89
00:08:54,213 --> 00:08:56,249
It doesn't matter.

90
00:08:56,282 --> 00:08:57,950
It's all about
how you choose to see it.

91
00:08:57,983 --> 00:09:00,286
Shit. I told you I was right.

92
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,522
- I'm Leo.
- Santos.

93
00:09:03,554 --> 00:09:05,557
Dom. What are you guys in for?

94
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,293
Driving while brown.

95
00:09:18,237 --> 00:09:20,472
You see that?

96
00:09:20,505 --> 00:09:22,274
Hairline crack in the fuel line.

97
00:09:22,307 --> 00:09:24,376
Air gets in there,
you got a lean condition.

98
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:26,345
Lean condition?

99
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,952
Yeah! Yeah, Jakob!

100
00:10:15,985 --> 00:10:18,455
That's what I'm talking about!

101
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:23,961
Who wants next?

102
00:10:23,994 --> 00:10:26,163
I said, who wants next?!

103
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:27,530
I got next.

104
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,001
Dom.

105
00:10:32,969 --> 00:10:34,737
Well, when'd you get out, man?

106
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:36,807
I said I got next.

107
00:10:38,574 --> 00:10:39,876
Come on, Dom.

108
00:10:41,177 --> 00:10:43,100
You don't want to race me
in Buddy's old charger.

109
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:45,637
Car don't make the driver.

110
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:55,647
Here's how this goes.

111
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,549
You win...

112
00:10:57,582 --> 00:10:59,884
You can come back home.

113
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:02,186
You lose...

114
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:04,957
You keep driving,
you don't stop,

115
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:07,192
you don't ever come back.

116
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:09,060
Ever.

117
00:11:10,194 --> 00:11:11,897
What do you mean, Dom?

118
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,998
I know what you did.

119
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:19,238
The day we lost him, dad kept
talking about a misfire.

120
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,872
Remember?

121
00:11:22,107 --> 00:11:24,243
You were the last one
under his hood that day.

122
00:11:26,678 --> 00:11:29,080
A minute later, he was gone.

123
00:11:29,114 --> 00:11:32,585
Tell me why you killed dad.

124
00:11:39,757 --> 00:11:41,660
Now let's race.

125
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,700
Armed robbery in echo park.

126
00:11:48,732 --> 00:11:51,135
- Fourth street bridge is open.
- Clear, clear, clear!

127
00:12:10,821 --> 00:12:13,224
Ready?

128
00:12:13,257 --> 00:12:14,526
Set.

129
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:18,029
Go.

130
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:43,281
Too soon.

131
00:13:51,422 --> 00:13:53,091
No!

132
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,569
How many calories
in each stick?

133
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:17,704
550.

134
00:14:20,307 --> 00:14:21,841
How many grams of fat?

135
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:25,378
32 grams, but we do
cook it in vegetable oil.

136
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:27,680
I'll take two then.

137
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,183
Could I have mine extra crispy?

138
00:14:30,183 --> 00:14:32,319
Sure. No problem.

139
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:33,720
It's not as hard as it looks.

140
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,622
All it takes is
the extra five minutes

141
00:14:35,622 --> 00:14:37,590
reading the manual
after you get hired.

142
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,193
The way I saw it,
as long as it made it

143
00:14:40,193 --> 00:14:43,363
on my college application,
it was all worth it.

144
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:44,831
You just can't count
on good grades

145
00:14:44,831 --> 00:14:46,466
to get into a decent
school anymore.

146
00:14:58,578 --> 00:15:01,981
Virgil and I have been friends
since the fourth grade,

147
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:03,350
when he moved to my school.

148
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,851
He was the other smart kid.

149
00:15:10,357 --> 00:15:12,825
Let's go, you perv.

150
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:15,562
Dude, did you see the
fucking rack on that?

151
00:15:15,562 --> 00:15:17,597
Man, middle-aged
hos are the finest.

152
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,635
This is Han, Virgil's cousin.

153
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:25,505
He's everything Virgil's not.

154
00:15:25,505 --> 00:15:27,374
You ladies ready?

155
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:44,991
I shoot 215 free throws a day.

156
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:48,194
My goal is to beat
Calvin Murphy's record

157
00:15:48,194 --> 00:15:49,929
of 95.8 percent.

158
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:51,964
That's 207 baskets.

159
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:57,804
Punctilious.

160
00:15:57,804 --> 00:16:00,840
"Marked by or concerned
about precise, exact accordance

161
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,476
with the details
of codes or conventions."

162
00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:05,244
To get a perfect score
on my next SAT

163
00:16:05,244 --> 00:16:08,147
I needed to improve
my verbal score by 60 points.

164
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:09,716
I picked a new word every day

165
00:16:09,716 --> 00:16:11,851
and repeated it over
and over again.

166
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:14,954
They say if you repeat
something enough times,

167
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:16,589
it becomes part of you.

168
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:18,858
Punctilious. Adjective.

169
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:21,628
"Marked by or concerned
about precise, exact accordance

170
00:16:21,628 --> 00:16:23,830
with the details
of codes or conventions."

171
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:27,527
Stephanie Vandergosh.

172
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:29,128
It's girls like her

173
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:31,498
that make you realize
that life's not fair.

174
00:17:31,498 --> 00:17:34,233
I swear, I saw her in a porn.

175
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:35,635
What are you babbling about?

176
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:40,006
Daric Loo, academic all-star.

177
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:42,642
But don't let the letterman
jacket fool you--

178
00:17:42,642 --> 00:17:44,043
it's for tennis.

179
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:46,979
Hey, so we're using your
credit card, right?

180
00:17:46,979 --> 00:17:48,214
If we get caught,

181
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:49,482
I'm saying you stole it from me.

182
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:51,484
Nigga, please.

183
00:17:51,484 --> 00:17:53,252
The amoeba

184
00:17:53,252 --> 00:17:55,388
is a primitive and simple organism,

185
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:56,756
which absorbs its prey

186
00:17:56,756 --> 00:18:02,895
and incorporates it into itself.

187
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:04,230
Miss Vandergosh

188
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,898
and Miss Nabham,

189
00:18:05,898 --> 00:18:07,600
is there something you would like

190
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,935
to share with the class?

191
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,805
I thought as much.

192
00:18:12,805 --> 00:18:17,477
Uh, Mr. Farmer, please switch
seats with Miss Vandergosh.

193
00:18:25,084 --> 00:18:28,254
Now that I have your
complete attention,

194
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:30,389
today we will see a movie.

195
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:35,428
It is entitled, The Amoeba.

196
00:18:54,881 --> 00:18:56,783
Lunch time was club time.

197
00:18:56,783 --> 00:18:58,951
This was where everyone loaded
up on their extracurricular

198
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:01,287
activities for their college app.

199
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:03,623
And, of course, Daric was
the president of every club.

200
00:19:03,623 --> 00:19:07,860
...but, being part of an ecology
club, it's important that we do.

201
00:19:09,796 --> 00:19:12,398
Unfortunately, all
the really worthwhile things

202
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:15,034
about high school
were few and far between.

203
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:16,603
She is right down the hall

204
00:19:16,603 --> 00:19:18,605
Well, what I'm
most concerned about

205
00:19:18,605 --> 00:19:21,240
are the abrasions
on her arms and her back.

206
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:37,289
It was my fault-- 
I fell down some stairs,

207
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:38,758
but I feel fine now.

208
00:19:38,758 --> 00:19:40,793
Don't get me wrong.
I mean, I think there's some

209
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:42,428
pretty fine-looking
bitches in high school.

210
00:19:42,428 --> 00:19:43,730
It's just that they're all

211
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,031
so fucking stingy
about giving it up.

212
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:46,432
Dude, you're a
fucking virgin.

213
00:19:46,432 --> 00:19:48,501
Dude, I can get laid
whenever I want to.

214
00:19:48,501 --> 00:19:51,504
Any time, anywhere, any place.

215
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:53,272
Yeah, by who, your
middle-aged aunt?

216
00:19:53,272 --> 00:19:54,473
No, but your mom's been

217
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:55,675
looking mighty fine lately.

218
00:19:55,675 --> 00:19:56,976
Hey, shut the fuck up.

219
00:19:56,976 --> 00:19:58,845
Especially with those...
what was that thing

220
00:19:58,845 --> 00:20:00,713
she bought the other day?

221
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:11,190
Okay, it comes to $482.82.

222
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:16,462
Is your brother Carl?

223
00:20:16,462 --> 00:20:17,764
Yeah.

224
00:20:17,764 --> 00:20:19,465
I thought you looked familiar.

225
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:21,534
I-I'm Virgil.
I was in, uh, Cub Scouts

226
00:20:21,534 --> 00:20:22,669
with your brother.

227
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:25,004
Oh, this is my friend, Ben.

228
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:26,038
Hi.
Hey.

229
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:27,506
So, uh, what are you
doing these days?

230
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:29,108
I just got out of college.

231
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:30,509
Oh, what was your major?

232
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:31,844
Theater.

233
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:34,446
Theater. That's, that's...

234
00:20:34,446 --> 00:20:35,782
I love the theater, you know.

235
00:20:35,782 --> 00:20:37,216
It's a...
Sign here.

236
00:20:37,216 --> 00:20:39,919
That makes you, like,
a thespian, right?

237
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,622
You know, you-you have that,
like, kind of an "X" factor,

238
00:20:42,622 --> 00:20:43,823
that charisma thing.

239
00:20:43,823 --> 00:20:45,992
You definitely got it going, really.

240
00:20:45,992 --> 00:20:47,126
Thanks.

241
00:20:48,695 --> 00:20:51,297
Well, it was nice
seeing you again.

242
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:52,565
Yeah. So... plays.

243
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:54,300
Let me know if
you're ever in one or...

244
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,301
Hey, Virg...
So.

245
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:57,103
Okay.
Yeah. Yeah, cool.

246
00:20:57,103 --> 00:20:58,237
Yeah, di...?

247
00:21:00,106 --> 00:21:02,041
What the fuck was that?
What?

248
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,442
You're gonna get us caught!

249
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:04,977
Watch it!

250
00:21:04,977 --> 00:21:07,179
Like she's gonna go for you.

251
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:08,815
At least I try.

252
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:11,851
That's enough, girls.

253
00:21:13,986 --> 00:21:15,788
We were always pissed at Virgil,

254
00:21:15,788 --> 00:21:17,389
but we always let it slide.

255
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:19,225
We had to--
he's like the little puppy

256
00:21:19,225 --> 00:21:21,160
that keeps shitting on the carpet.

257
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,261
Hey, Virg.

258
00:21:22,261 --> 00:21:25,331
What color is the sticker today, man?

259
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:27,066
Wake up!

260
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:28,334
Orange.

261
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:30,269
Give 'em up.

262
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:33,606
Let's go.

263
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,580
Fuck you.

264
00:22:05,972 --> 00:22:06,973
Hi.

265
00:22:06,973 --> 00:22:08,708
Hi.

266
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,677
It's my little brother,
and he came home

267
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:12,178
with all this computer stuff

268
00:22:12,178 --> 00:22:13,179
he can't afford.

269
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:14,113
So my mom...

270
00:22:14,113 --> 00:22:16,615
Yeah. Do you have a receipt?

271
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:33,599
It started with
a pack of baseball cards,

272
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,101
and then it snowballed.

273
00:22:35,101 --> 00:22:37,003
I guess it just felt good
to do things

274
00:22:37,003 --> 00:22:39,739
that I couldn't put
on my college application.

275
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:41,540
Besides, it was suburbia...

276
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,076
we had nothing better to do.

277
00:22:44,076 --> 00:22:46,078
Our straight A's were our alibis,

278
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:48,748
our passports to freedom.
Going to a study group

279
00:22:48,748 --> 00:22:52,184
would get us out of the house
until 4:00 in the morning.

280
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:55,354
As long as our grades
were there, we were trusted.

281
00:22:55,354 --> 00:22:56,889
We had it all.

282
00:22:56,889 --> 00:22:58,357
Well, almost.

283
00:22:58,357 --> 00:23:00,459
"Uncap the needle."

284
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:02,995
"Swab the finger
with the rubbing alcohol."

285
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:08,534
"Prick the finger."

286
00:23:09,736 --> 00:23:11,070
Come on, Ben.

287
00:23:12,705 --> 00:23:14,106
On three.

288
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:15,241
One...

289
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:19,145
See, that wasn't so bad.

290
00:23:25,117 --> 00:23:26,719
All right, let's go.
Come on, now.

291
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:28,387
Good job. Run! Come on, now.

292
00:23:28,387 --> 00:23:30,890
Get down, get down,
run, run, run.

293
00:23:32,124 --> 00:23:33,893
Stay low when you make
that pass.

294
00:23:33,893 --> 00:23:35,394
Got to get in front of him.
In front of him!

295
00:23:35,394 --> 00:23:37,797
Dive, come on!
Who wants that ball?

296
00:23:37,797 --> 00:23:38,798
Who wants it?

297
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:40,332
Don't stand up.

298
00:23:40,332 --> 00:23:41,868
Do not stand up.

299
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:51,443
Make two, we'll go home.

300
00:24:43,896 --> 00:24:45,397
Hey, Stephanie.

301
00:24:45,397 --> 00:24:46,698
Oh, hey, Ben.

302
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:48,835
How's it going?

303
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:50,102
Good.

304
00:24:50,102 --> 00:24:52,104
How's your finger?
Oh.

305
00:24:52,104 --> 00:24:53,539
I'll live.

306
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:56,242
You have a Band-Aid on it.

307
00:24:56,242 --> 00:24:57,109
Yeah.

308
00:24:57,109 --> 00:24:59,411
It's a pin prick.

309
00:24:59,411 --> 00:25:01,881
Don't you want to be
a doctor or something?

310
00:25:01,881 --> 00:25:04,183
If I don't play pro basketball.

311
00:25:04,183 --> 00:25:06,085
Aren't you a little short?

312
00:25:06,085 --> 00:25:08,454
Only the size of your heart matters.

313
00:25:08,454 --> 00:25:09,822
That's corny.

314
00:25:12,224 --> 00:25:14,160
What about you?
What do you want to be?

315
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:17,063
A cop.

316
00:25:17,063 --> 00:25:19,899
Really? Aren't you
a little too short?

317
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:22,434
Not when I have this.

318
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:24,503
Ooh.

319
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:34,446
You're late.

320
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:38,084
Sorry.

321
00:25:38,084 --> 00:25:39,418
And you're
not wearing a helmet.

322
00:25:43,022 --> 00:25:45,124
Oh. Ben, this is
my boyfriend, Steve.

323
00:25:45,124 --> 00:25:45,992
Steve,

324
00:25:45,992 --> 00:25:48,260
this is Ben, my lab partner.

325
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,729
Oh, yeah.

326
00:25:50,729 --> 00:25:52,999
I have something for you.

327
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:55,401
What is this?

328
00:25:55,401 --> 00:25:57,769
This isn't even due until next week.

329
00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:00,139
I had some free time
so I thought that--

330
00:26:00,139 --> 00:26:01,407
We're lab partners.

331
00:26:01,407 --> 00:26:04,010
We're supposed
to do this together.

332
00:26:05,945 --> 00:26:07,246
Give me a call.

333
00:26:07,246 --> 00:26:10,216
We'll meet to do the assignment.

334
00:26:17,689 --> 00:26:19,558
Let's go.
Later.

335
00:26:33,772 --> 00:26:35,241
It's amazing what the right

336
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:36,842
piece of clothing
can do for your image.

337
00:26:36,842 --> 00:26:38,644
I knew it was all bullshit,

338
00:26:38,644 --> 00:26:40,279
but, hell, I was milking it

339
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:41,948
for all it was worth.

340
00:26:41,948 --> 00:26:43,815
At first it didn't matter
that I rarely saw

341
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:45,017
any playing time.

342
00:26:45,017 --> 00:26:47,153
I was part of the team.

343
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:54,560
But like everything else
in life, you get sick of it.

344
00:27:00,332 --> 00:27:03,402
At least it'll look good
on my college app.

345
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:07,473
Okay.

346
00:27:07,473 --> 00:27:10,042
Ain't no party
like a Wildcat party

347
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:14,981
Ain't no party
like a Wildcat party.

348
00:27:19,986 --> 00:27:21,887
Look at that ass.

349
00:27:21,887 --> 00:27:23,655
Yeah. What's up, Ben?

350
00:27:23,655 --> 00:27:24,656
Hey, Daric.

351
00:27:24,656 --> 00:27:26,092
Hey, you got a sec?

352
00:27:26,092 --> 00:27:27,493
I'm trying to finish up
this assignment.

353
00:27:27,493 --> 00:27:28,627
Okay.
Cool.

354
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:34,000
So, Ben, how do you feel
about being a benchwarmer?

355
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,267
What?

356
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:37,536
Well, you don't get
to play much, right?

357
00:27:37,536 --> 00:27:40,772
Yeah, but we all have
our roles on the team.

358
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:43,142
And what is your role?

359
00:27:43,142 --> 00:27:45,511
I don't know.
I just hustle.

360
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:48,114
Well, then how come
you don't get to
play in the games?

361
00:27:48,114 --> 00:27:49,815
Well, it's up to the coach.

362
00:27:49,815 --> 00:27:51,117
Well, how do you feel

363
00:27:51,117 --> 00:27:53,585
about being the token
Asian on a team?

364
00:27:53,585 --> 00:27:54,420
What?

365
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,122
It's obvious to everyone

366
00:27:56,122 --> 00:27:58,224
the only reason that
you're on the team

367
00:27:58,224 --> 00:27:59,291
is for cosmetic ones.

368
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:00,492
That's bullshit.

369
00:28:00,492 --> 00:28:02,161
I bust my ass
to be on this team.

370
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:03,362
But you never get to play.

371
00:28:03,362 --> 00:28:05,131
So what?
I'm still on the team.

372
00:28:05,131 --> 00:28:07,399
Well, your coach
could've picked anyone

373
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:09,401
he wanted to just
to sit on the bench.

374
00:28:09,401 --> 00:28:11,237
Maybe you should
just ask him then.

375
00:28:11,237 --> 00:28:13,805
Okay. Awesome.

376
00:28:13,805 --> 00:28:15,307
Thanks, buddy.

377
00:28:15,307 --> 00:28:17,743
Hey, Takeshi, can you, uh,
give me a few close-ups

378
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:18,944
and a couple wides?

379
00:28:18,944 --> 00:28:21,080
Yeah, you got it.

380
00:28:39,431 --> 00:28:40,632
Hi.

381
00:28:40,632 --> 00:28:42,201
Is Stephanie home?

382
00:28:49,508 --> 00:28:50,709
Hi.

383
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:52,044
Hey.

384
00:29:00,386 --> 00:29:02,654
Stephanie, I just want
to apologize for...

385
00:29:03,589 --> 00:29:06,692
Ben, I'm in
three honor classes,

386
00:29:06,692 --> 00:29:08,460
and I have a 3.8 GPA.

387
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,230
I know and I'm sorry.

388
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:19,171
I couldn't find the traits
to phylum chordata in the book.

389
00:29:22,108 --> 00:29:23,742
Um, it's not in the book.

390
00:29:23,742 --> 00:29:25,177
It was in his lecture.

391
00:29:33,652 --> 00:29:35,154
See? It was
last Tuesday's lecture.

392
00:29:35,154 --> 00:29:36,355
...cells. This one is

393
00:29:36,355 --> 00:29:38,557
more of a non-sexual
cell division.

394
00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:40,459
Right. Okay.

395
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:41,860
And that's when mitosis happens...

396
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,861
That was one, anaphase?

397
00:29:42,861 --> 00:29:44,196
Anaphase.

398
00:29:44,196 --> 00:29:46,232
And then metaphase,
interphase and prophase.

399
00:29:46,232 --> 00:29:47,233
You got it.

400
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:50,169
Yes. Okay.

401
00:29:50,169 --> 00:29:52,538
I think you're right.
Let me just make sure.

402
00:29:52,538 --> 00:29:54,173
When I'm right, I'm right.

403
00:29:57,243 --> 00:29:58,977
You're right.

404
00:30:01,113 --> 00:30:02,148
Hello?

405
00:30:02,148 --> 00:30:03,682
Hey, Steve-o.

406
00:30:03,682 --> 00:30:07,119
Oh, Ben and I are working
on our bio homework.

407
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,456
Yes, I'm sure.

408
00:30:15,527 --> 00:30:17,896
Can you hold on a minute?

409
00:30:17,896 --> 00:30:20,132
I'll be right back.

410
00:30:20,132 --> 00:30:21,667
Yeah. What?

411
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:54,200
Do you want something to drink?

412
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,601
Are you okay?

413
00:30:55,601 --> 00:30:57,436
Yeah.

414
00:31:16,822 --> 00:31:18,290
Where are you going?

415
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:21,427
It's getting pretty late.

416
00:31:21,427 --> 00:31:23,762
But we haven't gone
through meiosis yet.

417
00:31:25,431 --> 00:31:27,899
Well, I could stay.

418
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,272
Thanks.

419
00:31:43,949 --> 00:31:46,785
Uh, okay. Meiosis.

420
00:31:49,355 --> 00:31:50,689
Hey, Ben.

421
00:31:53,158 --> 00:31:55,594
Be there for you, man,
every game.

422
00:32:06,238 --> 00:32:09,775
We want Ben! We want Ben!
We want Ben!

423
00:32:09,775 --> 00:32:12,043
Daric ended up writing
an article about me.

424
00:32:12,043 --> 00:32:14,646
He even won some kind
of journalism award for it.

425
00:32:14,646 --> 00:32:17,383
It was some bullshit article
about affirmative action

426
00:32:17,383 --> 00:32:19,385
in school sports
to rile everyone up.

427
00:32:19,385 --> 00:32:21,119
We want Ben! We want Ben!

428
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,755
But I had to give it to him...

429
00:32:23,755 --> 00:32:26,124
The article worked.
If anyone at school didn't know

430
00:32:26,124 --> 00:32:30,629
what affirmative action was,
they did now.

431
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:33,599
Aw sh... Ben, Ben, get in.

432
00:32:36,602 --> 00:32:39,104
Go on. Get the fuck in there.

433
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:40,306
Yeah!

434
00:32:53,184 --> 00:32:54,553
Math or verbal?

435
00:32:57,022 --> 00:32:58,790
What the fuck do you want?

436
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,627
So how does it feel
to be famous?

437
00:33:01,627 --> 00:33:03,128
Come on.

438
00:33:03,128 --> 00:33:05,897
Why'd you quit the team?

439
00:33:05,897 --> 00:33:08,500
I was doing my job.

440
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,236
You call that piece-of-shit
article journalism?

441
00:33:11,236 --> 00:33:14,740
You didn't even interview
my coach for his views.

442
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,974
I did.

443
00:33:15,974 --> 00:33:18,444
He, uh, didn't say
what I wanted him to,

444
00:33:18,444 --> 00:33:20,979
so I didn't put it in the story.

445
00:33:20,979 --> 00:33:24,282
Fucking prick.

446
00:33:24,282 --> 00:33:25,684
It's just an article.

447
00:33:25,684 --> 00:33:27,553
If you really liked
what you were doing,

448
00:33:27,553 --> 00:33:29,321
you should have
just kept on playing.

449
00:33:29,321 --> 00:33:31,189
And have everybody think
I'm on the team

450
00:33:31,189 --> 00:33:32,524
because I'm some token player?

451
00:33:32,524 --> 00:33:35,361
Who cares
what other people think?

452
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:36,728
Oh, yeah?
Well, people also think

453
00:33:36,728 --> 00:33:37,929
that you gave Mr. Reid head

454
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:39,665
to be the editor
of the school paper.

455
00:33:39,665 --> 00:33:44,169
Well, I still am the editor.

456
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:46,872
God. Fuck off.

457
00:33:49,475 --> 00:33:53,512
You know this is all bullshit, right?

458
00:33:53,512 --> 00:33:55,213
It's just a game.

459
00:33:55,213 --> 00:33:57,416
People like you and me,

460
00:33:57,416 --> 00:34:00,652
we don't have to play
by the rules.

461
00:34:00,652 --> 00:34:02,621
We can make our own.

462
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:12,998
Do this by tomorrow,
you get a fifty.

463
00:34:12,998 --> 00:34:14,232
What?

464
00:34:14,232 --> 00:34:17,836
Hey, I don't just ask anyone
to do this.

465
00:34:17,836 --> 00:34:19,638
Cheat sheets?

466
00:34:19,638 --> 00:34:21,840
It's easy money.

467
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:24,776
Ben,

468
00:34:24,776 --> 00:34:26,912
it's easier than fuck.

469
00:34:26,912 --> 00:34:30,549
It's better than
this sorry-ass job.

470
00:34:30,549 --> 00:34:32,951
See you tomorrow.

471
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:46,965
Hey, Ben.

472
00:34:46,965 --> 00:34:48,534
Hey.

473
00:34:48,534 --> 00:34:49,968
Uh, I'm getting my Diet Coke.

474
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:51,169
You guys want anything?

475
00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:52,404
Uh, yeah.

476
00:34:52,404 --> 00:34:53,605
Give me a root beer float to go.

477
00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:54,940
I got it.

478
00:35:04,149 --> 00:35:05,150
Trig?

479
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,685
Uh, yeah.

480
00:35:08,019 --> 00:35:09,220
Excuse me.

481
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,424
There's no smoking
allowed in this cafe.

482
00:35:12,424 --> 00:35:13,825
California state law.

483
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:14,960
Sorry.

484
00:35:19,898 --> 00:35:21,700
Can't wait till I get out.

485
00:35:22,768 --> 00:35:24,770
What are you majoring in
in college?

486
00:35:26,004 --> 00:35:27,272
Bio.

487
00:35:27,272 --> 00:35:29,040
Doing any internships?

488
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,275
No.

489
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:32,578
I know some people.
I'll give them a call.

490
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:36,448
Cool.

491
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:48,159
You like Steph.

492
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:50,996
What?

493
00:35:50,996 --> 00:35:53,499
You want to take her
to the winter formal?

494
00:35:54,766 --> 00:35:56,802
Isn't that your job?

495
00:35:56,802 --> 00:36:00,205
I don't get into
all that bullshit.

496
00:36:01,272 --> 00:36:03,675
Why, you a fag or something?

497
00:36:05,611 --> 00:36:06,945
What do you think?

498
00:36:10,148 --> 00:36:11,349
Hey.

499
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:13,519
Thanks.

500
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:14,886
Thanks, honey.

501
00:36:14,886 --> 00:36:16,922
Okay. Okay, I'll
see you soon?

502
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:23,662
Okay. Which species
should we start with?

503
00:36:25,063 --> 00:36:30,669
Um, I was... thinking
about the, uh, Chapter Eight.

504
00:36:55,493 --> 00:36:58,196
Temerity. Noun.

505
00:36:58,196 --> 00:37:01,967
"Unwise boldness;
rash or reckless behavior."

506
00:37:23,755 --> 00:37:26,892
Oh-oh.

507
00:37:26,892 --> 00:37:28,059
Nice.

508
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:29,861
Good job.

509
00:37:29,861 --> 00:37:31,697
Oh, shit. Sorry, dude.

510
00:37:31,697 --> 00:37:33,599
Hey, man. What's going on?

511
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:34,833
Popcorn?

512
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:36,702
So how much did we actually

513
00:37:36,702 --> 00:37:38,036
earn last year at the car wash?

514
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:40,105
Like $400 and something.

515
00:37:40,105 --> 00:37:42,173
So that's only like $400.

516
00:37:42,173 --> 00:37:44,643
We only got that
one day to do it, so....

517
00:37:44,643 --> 00:37:46,778
Uh, you guys mind
if we have a moment?

518
00:37:46,778 --> 00:37:47,779
Uh, me and Ben?

519
00:37:47,779 --> 00:37:48,914
Oh.
Yeah.
Okay.

520
00:37:48,914 --> 00:37:51,249
Okay, but we got
to talk about this.

521
00:37:51,249 --> 00:37:52,584
Sure. Thanks.

522
00:37:53,652 --> 00:37:54,953
What's up?

523
00:37:54,953 --> 00:37:56,087
Hey.

524
00:37:58,456 --> 00:37:59,791
Oh. Sweet.

525
00:38:02,661 --> 00:38:04,129
Aren't you gonna check it?

526
00:38:04,129 --> 00:38:06,665
Nah. I trust you.

527
00:38:09,868 --> 00:38:11,269
Get going?
Yeah.

528
00:38:11,269 --> 00:38:12,604
All right?

529
00:38:14,806 --> 00:38:17,142
Academic decathlon was huge.

530
00:38:17,142 --> 00:38:19,510
The most prized entry
on a college application.

531
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:22,147
This was not like
some community service club

532
00:38:22,147 --> 00:38:24,382
where you just
walk in and sign out.

533
00:38:24,382 --> 00:38:25,817
You had to earn your spot.

534
00:38:25,817 --> 00:38:27,686
Pygmy mouse
lemur.
Excellent.

535
00:38:27,686 --> 00:38:29,888
Tetrahydrocannabinol.

536
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,390
Jersey, Guernsey
and Albany.

537
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,659
Hands by your side.

538
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:34,660
Check.

539
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,827
Portugal!

540
00:38:35,827 --> 00:38:37,228
I didn't ask a question.

541
00:38:37,228 --> 00:38:38,029
Sorry!

542
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:40,498
Bohemia, Moravia
and Silesia.

543
00:38:40,498 --> 00:38:41,633
Correct.

544
00:38:41,633 --> 00:38:42,734
Johnson.

545
00:38:42,734 --> 00:38:43,835
Excellent.

546
00:38:43,835 --> 00:38:44,903
You're right.

547
00:38:44,903 --> 00:38:46,371
Another language that...

548
00:38:46,371 --> 00:38:47,438
Tokyo,
Japan.
Excellent.

549
00:38:47,438 --> 00:38:48,774
Ahh!
Correct.

550
00:38:53,111 --> 00:38:54,579
Hey.

551
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:55,914
See you in class.

552
00:38:59,517 --> 00:39:01,052
Good job, man.

553
00:39:01,052 --> 00:39:02,520
What are you
talking about?

554
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,521
I got my ass kicked.

555
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:04,823
No, you knew the answers.

556
00:39:04,823 --> 00:39:06,925
You just got to get
the timing down.

557
00:39:11,529 --> 00:39:14,332
50 bucks if you
do it by tomorrow.

558
00:39:16,802 --> 00:39:18,804
Dude, I think
we got enough.

559
00:39:18,804 --> 00:39:19,971
Stop bitching.

560
00:39:19,971 --> 00:39:21,372
Just a few more blocks.

561
00:39:24,442 --> 00:39:25,543
Did I tell you?

562
00:39:25,543 --> 00:39:26,978
I got it.
Got what?

563
00:39:26,978 --> 00:39:28,780
Remember I told you

564
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,982
I saw Stephanie
Vandergosh in a porn?

565
00:39:30,982 --> 00:39:31,783
Yeah.

566
00:39:31,783 --> 00:39:32,784
I got it.

567
00:39:32,784 --> 00:39:34,019
Shut the fuck up.

568
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:35,520
I'll show you right now, fool.

569
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,554
Oh, my God.

570
00:39:37,756 --> 00:39:40,125
Oh...

571
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,494
So you've been hanging around

572
00:39:43,494 --> 00:39:44,696
that Daric guy, right?

573
00:39:44,696 --> 00:39:45,831
Yeah.

574
00:39:45,831 --> 00:39:48,266
Is it true that he
has his own house?

575
00:39:48,266 --> 00:39:49,701
I don't know.

576
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:52,503
Hmm. Han told me that his
parents don't live here.

577
00:39:52,503 --> 00:39:54,639
They're in, like,
Vancouver or something.

578
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:56,074
So what?

579
00:39:56,074 --> 00:39:58,810
You know what I could
do if I had my own pad?

580
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,012
Jerk off at the dinner table?

581
00:40:01,012 --> 00:40:02,447
Ha-ha.

582
00:40:02,447 --> 00:40:03,581
Your turn.

583
00:40:03,581 --> 00:40:04,916
Fucker.

584
00:40:06,084 --> 00:40:06,885
What?

585
00:40:06,885 --> 00:40:08,086
No hot tub?

586
00:40:08,086 --> 00:40:10,388
Well, you tell them,
if they want me,

587
00:40:10,388 --> 00:40:13,224
they're gonna ante up
with that hot tub!

588
00:40:14,726 --> 00:40:17,162
Tracy, what are you doing here?

589
00:40:17,162 --> 00:40:20,732
Well, I can give you
a special Tracy massage.

590
00:40:20,732 --> 00:40:23,301
See? I told you, punk ass.

591
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:24,936
No.

592
00:40:24,936 --> 00:40:26,371
It's just the uniform.

593
00:40:26,371 --> 00:40:27,939
Uh-uh. It's got to be her.

594
00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:29,307
Oh, yes, Tracy.

595
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:30,575
Yeah.

596
00:40:30,575 --> 00:40:32,677
Work those pom-poms.

597
00:40:32,677 --> 00:40:34,312
I dare you to ask her boyfriend.

598
00:40:34,312 --> 00:40:35,313
White dude, right?

599
00:40:35,313 --> 00:40:36,882
No.
Thank God.

600
00:40:41,753 --> 00:40:42,754
Oh, yeah.

601
00:40:42,754 --> 00:40:43,755
Oh, yes.

602
00:40:43,755 --> 00:40:44,756
Shake those pom-poms.

603
00:40:44,756 --> 00:40:45,991
Ben?
Huh?

604
00:40:45,991 --> 00:40:47,625
You think you can
talk to Daric for me

605
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:48,960
about doing the cheat sheets?

606
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,595
Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.

607
00:40:50,595 --> 00:40:53,631
How do you know about it?

608
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:55,500
I hear things.

609
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,635
Han told me.

610
00:40:57,635 --> 00:40:59,070
Fucking Daric's a senior.

611
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:01,172
Someone's got to take
over when he leaves.

612
00:41:05,844 --> 00:41:08,279
All right. The topic is
population control,

613
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:10,782
why retarded children
and handicapped people

614
00:41:10,782 --> 00:41:12,050
should be executed

615
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,786
in order to keep
the population down. Ready?

616
00:41:15,921 --> 00:41:17,388
Is that true?
I think it was.

617
00:41:17,388 --> 00:41:19,490
'Cause it didn't sound
like you knew it.

618
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,893
Make sure your glasses
are anti-glare, okay?

619
00:41:21,893 --> 00:41:22,994
Let's see.
Oh...

620
00:41:22,994 --> 00:41:24,262
Decathlon practices were always

621
00:41:24,262 --> 00:41:26,164
held at Daric's house.
Finish it!

622
00:41:26,164 --> 00:41:28,533
His methods were
definitely unconventional

623
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:29,767
but effective.

624
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:30,802
Beautiful.

625
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,671
Rock, scissors, paper.

626
00:41:33,671 --> 00:41:34,840
Oh, fuck.

627
00:41:39,911 --> 00:41:43,148
I'm so unworthy
at this moment.

628
00:41:43,148 --> 00:41:44,115
Ah...

629
00:41:44,115 --> 00:41:45,283
Dude. Dude, dude,

630
00:41:45,283 --> 00:41:46,852
you're gonna explode, man.

631
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:48,253
Don't light that shit.

632
00:41:53,591 --> 00:41:55,460
Come on.

633
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,761
Oh.

634
00:41:56,761 --> 00:41:57,896
Good-bye, guys.

635
00:41:57,896 --> 00:41:59,264
Study hard.

636
00:42:01,666 --> 00:42:03,001
Come on.
Oh.

637
00:42:04,369 --> 00:42:06,571
Not bad for academic
decathlon, huh?

638
00:42:13,244 --> 00:42:15,113
Han had a friend named Jesus

639
00:42:15,113 --> 00:42:18,249
who helped him steal, bribe
or do whatever it took

640
00:42:18,249 --> 00:42:20,251
to get the test sheets for us.

641
00:42:20,251 --> 00:42:22,087
I talked to Daric
and he was cool

642
00:42:22,087 --> 00:42:24,589
with Virgil coming on board.
Between the five of us,

643
00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:27,025
there wasn't anything
we couldn't do.

644
00:42:32,563 --> 00:42:34,465
The money was really good,

645
00:42:34,465 --> 00:42:37,035
but I don't think that's
what attracted me the most.

646
00:42:59,157 --> 00:43:01,159
Okay, okay.

647
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:02,427
They got lucky.

648
00:43:02,427 --> 00:43:04,629
But, you know,
there is no reason

649
00:43:04,629 --> 00:43:05,997
a team of that caliber

650
00:43:05,997 --> 00:43:08,066
should be able
to beat us. God.

651
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:10,701
Mary!

652
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:12,003
Where's your tie?

653
00:43:12,003 --> 00:43:14,105
I mean, our presentation
absolutely sucked.

654
00:43:14,105 --> 00:43:15,506
We looked like idiots.

655
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:16,574
Rich, privey fucks.

656
00:43:16,574 --> 00:43:17,842
Press the button.

657
00:43:17,842 --> 00:43:19,577
Wait till
the question is asked.

658
00:43:19,577 --> 00:43:20,845
We're getting locked out

659
00:43:20,845 --> 00:43:22,680
and we can't even
answer the question.

660
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,848
God! Ben.

661
00:43:23,848 --> 00:43:25,250
Fucking twinkie.

662
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,385
American history specialist.

663
00:43:27,385 --> 00:43:30,121
The answer was 1973, not '76.

664
00:43:31,923 --> 00:43:33,191
How many more, Ben?

665
00:43:33,191 --> 00:43:34,325
Would you shut up?

666
00:43:34,325 --> 00:43:36,194
I told you guys not to come.

667
00:43:40,398 --> 00:43:41,299
Woo!

668
00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:42,667
So how's Stephanie?

669
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:43,801
Virg.

670
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:45,136
Stephanie Vandergosh?

671
00:43:45,136 --> 00:43:48,873
I'm going out
with her Friday night.

672
00:43:48,873 --> 00:43:50,875
I asked her out last week.

673
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:53,144
Does she know it's a date?

674
00:43:53,144 --> 00:43:55,880
Why? Want to lay
some money down on it?

675
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,048
Yeah.

676
00:43:57,048 --> 00:43:58,883
How 'bout an even hundred?

677
00:43:58,883 --> 00:44:00,285
Okay, you got it.

678
00:44:02,753 --> 00:44:03,888
Fucking A.

679
00:44:03,888 --> 00:44:06,491
You motherfucker.

680
00:44:19,637 --> 00:44:20,905
This is fucked.

681
00:44:20,905 --> 00:44:23,041
Hey, Daric wanted us to see it.

682
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:25,076
You know she has a boyfriend.

683
00:44:25,076 --> 00:44:26,277
Well, this'll teach that fuckhead

684
00:44:26,277 --> 00:44:27,612
to keep his mouth shut.

685
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,186
Oh, fuck.

686
00:44:35,186 --> 00:44:38,223
Is that the guy
from the privey school?

687
00:44:42,427 --> 00:44:45,863
What does he think he is,
some Chinese movie star?

688
00:44:45,863 --> 00:44:49,300
Hi, I am Chow Yun-Fat.

689
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,402
Hi. I-I-I thought

690
00:44:51,402 --> 00:44:54,105
I was gonna be fucking your
girlfriend tonight.

691
00:44:54,105 --> 00:44:55,140
I-I guess not.

692
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,441
I guess I better go home

693
00:44:56,441 --> 00:44:58,076
and stroke myself really good.

694
00:44:58,076 --> 00:44:59,277
Let's go.

695
00:44:59,277 --> 00:45:00,911
Really, really good.

696
00:45:00,911 --> 00:45:02,313
Ahh!

697
00:45:02,313 --> 00:45:04,282
Hey, hold on,
I'm just getting started.

698
00:45:07,152 --> 00:45:08,519
Get the fuck off my car.

699
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:10,055
Ow.

700
00:45:10,055 --> 00:45:11,556
Damn, dude.

701
00:45:14,992 --> 00:45:16,394
Dude, you got to tell Stephanie

702
00:45:16,394 --> 00:45:18,163
her boyfriend's boning
some white chick.

703
00:45:18,163 --> 00:45:20,698
It's none of my business.

704
00:45:20,698 --> 00:45:22,667
What the fuck are
you talking about?

705
00:45:22,667 --> 00:45:24,902
You tell her and
you get bonus points.

706
00:45:24,902 --> 00:45:26,204
I'm not gonna be some rat.

707
00:45:26,204 --> 00:45:28,173
Besides, I don't
even know for sure.

708
00:45:28,173 --> 00:45:31,042
Come on, Ben. Look...

709
00:45:33,178 --> 00:45:35,646
This... is for buddies.

710
00:45:35,646 --> 00:45:36,614
So?

711
00:45:36,614 --> 00:45:38,349
And this is where
he had his hands...

712
00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:39,550
which is for lovers.

713
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:40,551
God! Get off me!

714
00:45:40,551 --> 00:45:42,453
Am I right, Han?

715
00:45:50,428 --> 00:45:52,630
Daric, where you going?

716
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:54,965
Mm. Oh, sh...

717
00:45:54,965 --> 00:45:56,867
Yo, fuck her, man.
Let's go drink.

718
00:45:56,867 --> 00:45:58,203
Hey!

719
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:08,045
Shit. No, Daric!

720
00:46:44,315 --> 00:46:46,351
Whose party is this?

721
00:46:46,351 --> 00:46:47,852
Susie Berk's.

722
00:46:47,852 --> 00:46:49,019
Are we invited?

723
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:50,621
You don't need an invitation.

724
00:46:50,621 --> 00:46:52,123
Just hear about
it and you go.

725
00:46:52,123 --> 00:46:53,691
They're all fucking
drunk, anyway.

726
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:55,160
So, is everyone buzzed?

727
00:46:59,664 --> 00:47:01,299
Yo, can I have a light?

728
00:47:01,299 --> 00:47:03,234
Thanks, dude.

729
00:47:04,335 --> 00:47:06,237
Let's go around back.

730
00:47:14,379 --> 00:47:16,447
Hey, how's it goin'?

731
00:47:22,587 --> 00:47:23,788
Ah...!

732
00:47:24,789 --> 00:47:26,257
Now I'm gonna throw up.

733
00:47:47,178 --> 00:47:48,813
Hey, what's up, boys?

734
00:47:48,813 --> 00:47:51,182
I think they have...
bible study's next door, right?

735
00:47:53,318 --> 00:47:55,320
Oh, shit, no, look at this!

736
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,322
It's the Chinese Jordan!

737
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:00,591
Hey, so,
what's up, man?

738
00:48:00,591 --> 00:48:02,360
Where's all your
fan club at, man?

739
00:48:05,296 --> 00:48:07,298
I'm going to go
check on Virg.

740
00:48:12,337 --> 00:48:15,640
Yeah, what's
up, shithead?

741
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,807
Are you going
to step up?

742
00:48:16,807 --> 00:48:18,776
You know, you got
to play a real sport

743
00:48:18,776 --> 00:48:20,044
to wear that jacket.

744
00:48:20,044 --> 00:48:21,412
Yeah, fuck him up, Brian!

745
00:48:34,359 --> 00:48:36,961
Want your mom?
Huh? You want the cops?

746
00:48:38,162 --> 00:48:39,364
You're what?
You're what?

747
00:48:39,364 --> 00:48:40,365
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

748
00:48:40,365 --> 00:48:42,099
What?!
I'm sorry.

749
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:44,435
Shoot him in the face.

750
00:48:44,435 --> 00:48:45,703
Shoot him in the face.
If I ever see any of you

751
00:48:45,703 --> 00:48:47,104
and your fuck
jock friends again,

752
00:48:47,104 --> 00:48:48,506
I'll fucking kill you!

753
00:48:50,107 --> 00:48:53,010
Back off, man,
back off!

754
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:54,211
You want some of this?!

755
00:48:54,211 --> 00:48:55,813
Back off, man!
Ben, come on!

756
00:48:57,982 --> 00:48:59,049
Back off!

757
00:48:59,049 --> 00:49:00,217
Come on, Ben!

758
00:49:01,252 --> 00:49:02,687
Come on, Ben!

759
00:49:02,687 --> 00:49:04,255
Fuck you, man!

760
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,256
Screw you!

761
00:49:05,256 --> 00:49:06,591
Let's go!

762
00:49:22,473 --> 00:49:25,175
Fuckin' A,
that was better than sex.

763
00:49:25,175 --> 00:49:28,245
Just shut the fuck up.

764
00:49:29,514 --> 00:49:33,150
Did you see the look
on that guy's face?

765
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:34,485
You put the fear

766
00:49:34,485 --> 00:49:35,486
of God in him, man.

767
00:49:35,486 --> 00:49:37,455
The fear of Gods.

768
00:49:37,455 --> 00:49:39,457
I went jihad
on his ass, man.

769
00:49:40,791 --> 00:49:42,226
You see this
blood on me, man?

770
00:49:42,226 --> 00:49:43,494
It's not my blood.

771
00:49:43,494 --> 00:49:45,796
Did you see his face
when we worked on him?

772
00:49:45,796 --> 00:49:47,197
It was like...

773
00:49:50,901 --> 00:49:53,170
Fuck, man, when you
pulled out that gun,

774
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:54,905
it was fucking awesome.

775
00:49:54,905 --> 00:49:57,575
That was, like, boom!

776
00:49:57,575 --> 00:49:59,310
Right in your face.

777
00:50:02,513 --> 00:50:05,182
He probably pissed himself
right then

778
00:50:05,182 --> 00:50:06,717
in front
of all his homies.

779
00:50:06,717 --> 00:50:09,186
Not me, man.
I was going off.

780
00:50:09,186 --> 00:50:10,455
I felt so...
I felt like

781
00:50:10,455 --> 00:50:13,324
surging through my body.

782
00:50:13,324 --> 00:50:14,759
How smooth was that?

783
00:50:14,759 --> 00:50:16,160
Man, you had fucking balls!

784
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,495
That was fucking smooth!

785
00:50:20,765 --> 00:50:23,167
The next minute, the gun
was right in his face,

786
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:26,371
and I was going off--
ah, yeah!

787
00:50:29,273 --> 00:50:33,711
Shit.

788
00:50:33,711 --> 00:50:36,881
If my dad finds out,
he's going to kill me.

789
00:50:50,628 --> 00:50:53,631
Man, I'm going to juvie!

790
00:51:08,112 --> 00:51:11,181
By Monday, the word had spread

791
00:51:11,181 --> 00:51:13,918
and pretty much everyone
knew about it.

792
00:51:26,196 --> 00:51:29,800
I was sure the cops were gonna
come and get us that morning...

793
00:51:33,237 --> 00:51:35,473
but it never happened.

794
00:51:36,841 --> 00:51:38,743
Meeting today at 3:00.
Why?

795
00:51:38,743 --> 00:51:40,445
We have to do
this chem test.

796
00:51:40,445 --> 00:51:42,279
It's a big one,
about a hundred students.

797
00:51:42,279 --> 00:51:44,582
Guys...

798
00:51:46,216 --> 00:51:47,418
Hi, guys.

799
00:51:47,418 --> 00:51:49,253
Hey.
Hey.

800
00:51:49,253 --> 00:51:51,321
Ben, can I talk to you?

801
00:51:51,321 --> 00:51:52,657
Yeah.

802
00:51:56,894 --> 00:51:59,163
He's fuckin'
whupped already.

803
00:52:05,035 --> 00:52:06,036
What's up?

804
00:52:06,036 --> 00:52:07,805
I just talked to Steve.

805
00:52:07,805 --> 00:52:09,840
Yeah...

806
00:52:11,341 --> 00:52:13,143
What?

807
00:52:13,143 --> 00:52:15,480
He said you're taking me
to the formal.

808
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,815
You're fucking with me, right?

809
00:52:17,815 --> 00:52:19,917
He said that you guys agreed

810
00:52:19,917 --> 00:52:21,552
to have you take me
to the formal.

811
00:52:21,552 --> 00:52:23,788
He did ask, I didn't agree.

812
00:52:23,788 --> 00:52:25,523
The whole thing
was pretty weird.

813
00:52:25,523 --> 00:52:27,324
You should have
at least told me.

814
00:52:27,324 --> 00:52:29,760
Well, he's your boyfriend.
I didn't want to get involved.

815
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,630
Ben, that's what friends do.

816
00:52:35,299 --> 00:52:36,534
God, I don't believe this.

817
00:52:36,534 --> 00:52:39,136
Why do I always get shit on?

818
00:52:39,136 --> 00:52:40,237
You know, Steve,

819
00:52:40,237 --> 00:52:41,872
he's the one that
needs to stop...

820
00:52:41,872 --> 00:52:43,674
Ben, I'm just trying
to understand this.

821
00:52:43,674 --> 00:52:45,876
I'm out of here.

822
00:52:57,354 --> 00:52:59,156
What the fuck?!

823
00:53:00,958 --> 00:53:02,292
Woo!

824
00:53:02,292 --> 00:53:04,294
What? The formal?

825
00:53:04,294 --> 00:53:07,932
Oh, what, got a hot date
with Barbie that night?

826
00:53:07,932 --> 00:53:09,800
Look, I'm not gonna
say anything,

827
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,970
all right, it's none
of my business.

828
00:53:14,872 --> 00:53:17,675
I just think
she deserves better.

829
00:53:17,675 --> 00:53:19,143
You're probably right.

830
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:25,049
As our reputation grew,
scams started coming to us.

831
00:53:25,049 --> 00:53:27,417
Usually through Jesus.
There they are.

832
00:53:27,417 --> 00:53:29,687
What I liked about it was
that we were in control.

833
00:53:29,687 --> 00:53:31,522
If someone came to us
about doing a scam

834
00:53:31,522 --> 00:53:34,324
and we didn't like them,
we'd tell them to fuck off.

835
00:53:34,324 --> 00:53:38,395
Having that kind of power
quickly became an addiction.

836
00:53:38,395 --> 00:53:39,597
What's up?

837
00:53:39,597 --> 00:53:41,231
How's it going, man?

838
00:53:41,231 --> 00:53:43,000
What's going on?
How are you doing?

839
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,603
Man, not too bad.

840
00:53:45,603 --> 00:53:47,037
This is Peter.

841
00:53:47,037 --> 00:53:49,339
So, what's up?

842
00:53:49,339 --> 00:53:51,475
Peter's got a sweet deal.

843
00:53:51,475 --> 00:53:54,545
The school's getting in all new
computer parts next week.

844
00:53:54,545 --> 00:53:55,946
So?

845
00:53:55,946 --> 00:53:57,748
So they've got to store them
for a while

846
00:53:57,748 --> 00:53:58,949
until they can install them.

847
00:53:58,949 --> 00:54:00,551
Peter's got the school codes.

848
00:54:00,551 --> 00:54:01,986
Can they trace the code?

849
00:54:01,986 --> 00:54:03,621
No, it's all the same number
for everyone.

850
00:54:03,621 --> 00:54:05,189
What about that
fucking family

851
00:54:05,189 --> 00:54:06,957
that lives in the trailer 
guarding the school?

852
00:54:06,957 --> 00:54:08,959
That's me and my dad.

853
00:54:08,959 --> 00:54:11,095
He's out by 10:00.

854
00:54:11,095 --> 00:54:12,563
It's easy.

855
00:54:12,563 --> 00:54:15,700
I don't know.
Sounds too easy.

856
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,434
Dude, I guarantee.

857
00:54:17,434 --> 00:54:18,969
No offense,

858
00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:20,905
I don't give a shit
about your guarantee.

859
00:54:20,905 --> 00:54:22,707
Me and Ben checked it out.

860
00:54:22,707 --> 00:54:24,074
Seems legit.

861
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:28,646
Han, think you can
sell this shit off?

862
00:54:28,646 --> 00:54:31,281
I can always sell
the shit off.

863
00:54:31,281 --> 00:54:33,317
We'll think about it.

864
00:54:41,191 --> 00:54:42,593
Peter, let's go.

865
00:54:45,529 --> 00:54:46,797
You got the phone?
Uh-huh.

866
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:11,155
Ah, God. Fuck.

867
00:55:16,526 --> 00:55:17,862
It's clear.

868
00:55:44,689 --> 00:55:46,423
We had the run of the place.

869
00:55:46,423 --> 00:55:49,559
Rumors about us came
and went fast and furious.

870
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:51,929
One had us linked
with some Chinese Mafia.

871
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:53,497
And it was fine with us

872
00:55:53,497 --> 00:55:55,632
because it just put more fear
in everyone.

873
00:55:58,035 --> 00:56:00,604
Along with that power
came greed.

874
00:56:00,604 --> 00:56:03,607
It just made sense to expand
our business into drugs,

875
00:56:03,607 --> 00:56:06,510
putting the law of supply
and demand into practice.

876
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:09,947
I think our teacher
would've been proud.

877
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:35,139
Whoa.

878
00:56:36,841 --> 00:56:38,375
Let me see this thing.

879
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:39,409
Fuck off.

880
00:56:39,409 --> 00:56:42,212
It's got no
name brand on it.

881
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:47,985
Aw...!

882
00:56:47,985 --> 00:56:49,086
Shit.

883
00:56:49,086 --> 00:56:51,188
Sorry, Virg.

884
00:56:51,188 --> 00:56:53,724
Fuckin' dick.

885
00:56:53,724 --> 00:56:55,225
Stop crying.

886
00:56:55,225 --> 00:56:57,227
It's a piece-of-shit
CD player anyway.

887
00:56:57,227 --> 00:56:58,963
Fuck you!

888
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:04,001
Here.

889
00:57:04,001 --> 00:57:06,203
Now you can buy three of 'em.

890
00:57:14,812 --> 00:57:17,581
I soon learned that along with
an image, came maintenance.

891
00:57:17,581 --> 00:57:21,585
I needed something
to help expand my days.

892
00:57:21,585 --> 00:57:24,154
It's literally a full-time job
just to make people believe

893
00:57:24,154 --> 00:57:25,956
who you're supposed to be.

894
00:57:25,956 --> 00:57:29,593
Four cheat sheets a day,
the drugs, the scams--

895
00:57:29,593 --> 00:57:31,561
between this and
all my club commitments,

896
00:57:31,561 --> 00:57:34,498
I couldn't even start
my homework until 1:00 a.m.

897
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,922
We were making so much money,

898
00:57:57,922 --> 00:57:59,556
we couldn't spend it
fast enough.

899
00:57:59,556 --> 00:58:03,794
If it was for sale, you could
bet we tried to buy it.

900
00:58:03,794 --> 00:58:04,829
Is that enough?
Mm-hmm.

901
00:58:04,829 --> 00:58:06,831
All right.

902
00:58:06,831 --> 00:58:08,032
Hey, Tracy.

903
00:58:08,032 --> 00:58:09,466
Thanks, it's all there.

904
00:58:09,466 --> 00:58:10,868
Thank you.

905
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:14,805
So, what are you guys?

906
00:58:14,805 --> 00:58:16,941
A club.

907
00:58:16,941 --> 00:58:18,575
Oh, like a math club
or something?

908
00:58:21,778 --> 00:58:23,848
We partied every weekend

909
00:58:23,848 --> 00:58:25,415
and hung out
with different crowds.

910
00:58:25,415 --> 00:58:27,918
It's funny,
the more notorious we became,

911
00:58:27,918 --> 00:58:29,619
the more invitations we got.

912
00:58:29,619 --> 00:58:32,156
We didn't know half the people
we partied with...

913
00:58:32,156 --> 00:58:33,790
but they knew us.

914
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:07,958
Quixotic. Adjective.

915
00:59:07,958 --> 00:59:10,460
Extravagantly idealistic;

916
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:14,364
unpredictable;
unrealistic or imaginary.

917
00:59:21,671 --> 00:59:23,373
Shit.

918
00:59:48,899 --> 00:59:49,900
You look like shit.

919
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:52,036
Fifty.

920
00:59:54,905 --> 00:59:56,941
Oh, yeah.

921
00:59:56,941 --> 00:59:58,142
Here's the number
for that internship

922
00:59:58,142 --> 00:59:59,343
I was telling you about.

923
00:59:59,343 --> 01:00:01,078
Thanks.

924
01:00:02,512 --> 01:00:04,248
Yeah. You want some?

925
01:00:17,827 --> 01:00:19,163
You happy, Ben?

926
01:00:23,033 --> 01:00:24,534
I'm serious.

927
01:00:24,534 --> 01:00:27,037
You happy?

928
01:00:27,037 --> 01:00:29,373
I don't know.

929
01:00:29,373 --> 01:00:31,541
Fuck.

930
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:33,577
That's the most truthful thing
I've ever heard.

931
01:00:36,013 --> 01:00:37,681
At least you have a choice.

932
01:00:40,217 --> 01:00:41,785
You're not happy?

933
01:00:41,785 --> 01:00:43,954
I'm very happy.

934
01:00:43,954 --> 01:00:45,255
Isn't it obvious?

935
01:00:45,255 --> 01:00:46,856
I have everything.

936
01:00:46,856 --> 01:00:50,360
Loving parents, top grades,

937
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,196
Ivy League scholarships,

938
01:00:52,196 --> 01:00:54,231
of course, Stephanie.

939
01:00:55,399 --> 01:00:56,600
Of course.

940
01:00:58,868 --> 01:01:00,637
Right there.

941
01:01:00,637 --> 01:01:01,972
That's it.

942
01:01:04,074 --> 01:01:06,710
I'm so fucking happy
I can't stop it.

943
01:01:09,346 --> 01:01:10,580
Why not?

944
01:01:11,515 --> 01:01:13,883
It's a never-ending cycle.

945
01:01:13,883 --> 01:01:16,720
When you got everything
you want, what's left?

946
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,688
You can't settle
for being happy,

947
01:01:18,688 --> 01:01:20,224
that's a fucking trap.

948
01:01:20,224 --> 01:01:21,758
You got to take life
into your own hands.

949
01:01:21,758 --> 01:01:24,761
Do whatever it takes
to break the cycle.

950
01:01:24,761 --> 01:01:28,132
That's what it is,
breaking the cycle.

951
01:01:29,733 --> 01:01:32,602
You're fucked.

952
01:01:32,602 --> 01:01:34,138
I envy you.

953
01:01:39,743 --> 01:01:41,245
What?

954
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,684
What?

955
01:01:49,953 --> 01:01:52,322
What? What?

956
01:02:04,901 --> 01:02:07,671
It was my 17th birthday.

957
01:02:14,944 --> 01:02:16,513
No shit, man.

958
01:02:16,513 --> 01:02:18,315
Fuck, man.
I don't want to touch that.

959
01:02:18,315 --> 01:02:20,484
I don't want to touch it
with my hands, man.

960
01:02:20,484 --> 01:02:22,286
There he is.

961
01:02:24,454 --> 01:02:26,656
Hey, ass-wipe,
you're the one that organized

962
01:02:26,656 --> 01:02:28,492
this "Keep the Beach Clean"
shit and you're late.

963
01:02:28,492 --> 01:02:30,960
I need to talk to you guys.

964
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,297
Grab a bag.

965
01:02:33,297 --> 01:02:35,365
Where's Han?

966
01:02:35,365 --> 01:02:37,467
Sleeping.

967
01:02:56,886 --> 01:02:58,088
What's up?

968
01:02:58,088 --> 01:03:01,425
This better be
fucking good.

969
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,295
I want out.

970
01:03:07,697 --> 01:03:09,133
Out of what?

971
01:03:09,133 --> 01:03:11,368
I can't handle this anymore.

972
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:16,273
Look, I woke up and my sheets
were covered in blood.

973
01:03:16,273 --> 01:03:17,574
Well, why don't you stop

974
01:03:17,574 --> 01:03:19,309
OD'ing on that shit,
you fuck?

975
01:03:19,309 --> 01:03:21,678
Yeah, too much of that shit
will get to you.

976
01:03:21,678 --> 01:03:23,547
I don't want to do it anymore.

977
01:03:23,547 --> 01:03:24,381
All of it.

978
01:03:24,381 --> 01:03:26,983
Fuck, Ben, stop being a pussy.

979
01:03:26,983 --> 01:03:28,652
Whatever, Virg.

980
01:03:29,886 --> 01:03:31,388
So is that it?

981
01:03:31,388 --> 01:03:33,257
Yeah, I just...

982
01:03:33,257 --> 01:03:35,792
I just want to concentrate
on my own stuff.

983
01:03:35,792 --> 01:03:38,662
Hell, I was thinking
the same thing.

984
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:42,266
Give it up?
Yeah.

985
01:03:42,266 --> 01:03:44,834
Fuck it. It's like a job, man.

986
01:03:44,834 --> 01:03:48,272
The only reason I did
it was for you guys.

987
01:03:50,807 --> 01:03:52,142
What are you saying?

988
01:03:53,543 --> 01:03:55,812
Have you two lost
your fucking balls?

989
01:03:59,949 --> 01:04:00,984
Fuck it.

990
01:04:00,984 --> 01:04:02,886
Han and I will do it.

991
01:04:02,886 --> 01:04:04,321
Right, Han?

992
01:04:04,321 --> 01:04:05,989
It's all yours, man.

993
01:04:08,192 --> 01:04:09,259
We got to talk.

994
01:04:09,259 --> 01:04:10,594
Just shut the fuck up.

995
01:04:10,594 --> 01:04:13,730
More money
for us.

996
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:17,033
I'm gonna call Jesus
right after this.

997
01:04:17,033 --> 01:04:19,135
Organize this shit.

998
01:04:19,135 --> 01:04:21,905
Well...

999
01:04:21,905 --> 01:04:23,640
Happy birthday, man.

1000
01:04:29,613 --> 01:04:30,480
Thanks.

1001
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,582
We all chipped in.

1002
01:04:41,157 --> 01:04:42,926
Pretty cool, huh?

1003
01:04:44,394 --> 01:04:46,196
Jesus Christ!
Shit!
Fuck!

1004
01:04:48,031 --> 01:04:50,334
Hey.

1005
01:05:07,083 --> 01:05:08,685
Temperance. Noun.

1006
01:05:08,685 --> 01:05:12,822
Signifying self-restraint
or moderation

1007
01:05:12,822 --> 01:05:15,325
in action and statement.

1008
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:42,419
Hi, Stephanie.

1009
01:05:44,721 --> 01:05:45,922
Hi.

1010
01:05:45,922 --> 01:05:47,857
You need help?

1011
01:05:47,857 --> 01:05:49,393
I'm okay.

1012
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:59,436
You know, I hate 
doing those S's.

1013
01:05:59,436 --> 01:06:02,005
The curves
make it tough,

1014
01:06:02,005 --> 01:06:03,873
but I know a trick.

1015
01:06:06,276 --> 01:06:09,879
You work it inside out.

1016
01:06:09,879 --> 01:06:11,781
See?

1017
01:06:33,903 --> 01:06:37,474
So, what's this I hear
about you, gangster boy?

1018
01:06:37,474 --> 01:06:38,942
Oh, God, that's
such old news.

1019
01:06:38,942 --> 01:06:42,512
Rumors have it you guys
did a number on Ryan.

1020
01:06:42,512 --> 01:06:44,414
Do you believe them?

1021
01:06:44,414 --> 01:06:45,715
Let's put it this way,

1022
01:06:45,715 --> 01:06:47,751
there's also a rumor
that I am in a porno.

1023
01:06:47,751 --> 01:06:49,018
Oh, yeah, I've seen it.

1024
01:06:49,018 --> 01:06:50,019
Shut up.

1025
01:06:50,019 --> 01:06:51,020
Yeah, I have.

1026
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:52,088
Really?
Yeah.

1027
01:06:52,088 --> 01:06:53,189
So the shooting arm

1028
01:06:53,189 --> 01:06:54,791
is perpendicular
to the body?

1029
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:56,860
Mm-hmm.
Bend your knees
and follow through.

1030
01:07:08,104 --> 01:07:10,306
Is that it?

1031
01:07:10,306 --> 01:07:12,376
I'm hungry.

1032
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:35,965
Excuse me, sir.

1033
01:07:35,965 --> 01:07:38,134
There's no food
allowed in the store.

1034
01:07:38,134 --> 01:07:39,302
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

1035
01:07:39,302 --> 01:07:40,537
I'm hypoglycemic

1036
01:07:40,537 --> 01:07:42,739
and I just need
a little something

1037
01:07:42,739 --> 01:07:44,641
to get my blood sugar going.

1038
01:07:44,641 --> 01:07:47,176
I just got a couple
more bites left.

1039
01:07:47,176 --> 01:07:48,512
Okay.

1040
01:07:52,549 --> 01:07:54,851
You think you can get away
with anything, don't you?

1041
01:07:54,851 --> 01:07:56,753
No.

1042
01:07:56,753 --> 01:08:00,390
Well, yeah, if you're
clever enough.

1043
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:02,859
You sound just like Steve.

1044
01:08:05,929 --> 01:08:08,398
You don't like
him much, do you?

1045
01:08:09,999 --> 01:08:12,469
Speaking of Steve,

1046
01:08:12,469 --> 01:08:16,239
um, you still need
a date for the formal?

1047
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:17,674
Are you asking?

1048
01:08:17,674 --> 01:08:20,577
Well, if you'll go with me.

1049
01:08:58,948 --> 01:09:00,984
Oh, yeah.

1050
01:09:04,588 --> 01:09:06,723
Holy shit.

1051
01:09:06,723 --> 01:09:11,695
I guess I was clever enough,
thank you very much.

1052
01:09:39,789 --> 01:09:42,592
A week later Han
got suspended from school

1053
01:09:42,592 --> 01:09:44,160
for distributing cheat sheets.

1054
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:46,029
It appeared
that Virgil's new position

1055
01:09:46,029 --> 01:09:48,732
as head of the outfit
had gone to his head.

1056
01:09:48,732 --> 01:09:50,700
He was babbling
to so many people about it,

1057
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:52,869
the school had to do something.

1058
01:09:52,869 --> 01:09:54,437
The funny thing was,

1059
01:09:54,437 --> 01:09:57,874
Han didn't really care
that he got suspended.

1060
01:09:57,874 --> 01:09:59,643
I think it just gave him
yet another excuse

1061
01:09:59,643 --> 01:10:02,779
to beat the crap out of Virgil.

1062
01:10:16,893 --> 01:10:17,994
Hey.
Hey.

1063
01:10:17,994 --> 01:10:20,263
You look great.
You look great.

1064
01:10:20,263 --> 01:10:23,066
Jinx.

1065
01:10:23,066 --> 01:10:24,433
Two for flinching.

1066
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:26,135
Ow!

1067
01:10:26,135 --> 01:10:27,604
Here.

1068
01:10:27,604 --> 01:10:28,838
Thank you.

1069
01:10:28,838 --> 01:10:30,039
Jeez.

1070
01:10:39,015 --> 01:10:41,818
So, do you know
your real parents?

1071
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:45,889
Do you want to?

1072
01:10:45,889 --> 01:10:48,524
My parents I have now
are my real parents.

1073
01:10:53,496 --> 01:10:55,298
I don't know.

1074
01:10:55,298 --> 01:10:57,133
Maybe when I get older.

1075
01:10:59,569 --> 01:11:02,471
I still have to find out
who I am.

1076
01:11:02,471 --> 01:11:04,440
Yeah.

1077
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,843
You sound so mature.

1078
01:11:06,843 --> 01:11:09,746
That's what my therapist
tells me, at least.

1079
01:11:13,717 --> 01:11:16,085
Thanks for asking, though.

1080
01:13:00,857 --> 01:13:03,693
Uh, I had a wonderful time.

1081
01:13:24,447 --> 01:13:25,715
Thanks again.

1082
01:13:25,715 --> 01:13:27,116
Yeah.

1083
01:13:47,503 --> 01:13:49,338
All right, question six:

1084
01:13:49,338 --> 01:13:51,574
name of the largest
commercial transport jet.

1085
01:13:51,574 --> 01:13:52,842
Virgil!

1086
01:13:52,842 --> 01:13:54,077
The Space Guppy.

1087
01:13:54,077 --> 01:13:56,145
Where the fuck is he, man?

1088
01:13:56,145 --> 01:13:57,346
Jesus.

1089
01:13:57,346 --> 01:13:58,547
Hey, open up, man.

1090
01:13:58,547 --> 01:14:00,183
Where the fuck you going, man--

1091
01:14:00,183 --> 01:14:01,017
on a honeymoon?

1092
01:14:01,017 --> 01:14:02,618
No, man; I got my accessories.

1093
01:14:02,618 --> 01:14:04,320
Yeah, what, your anal intruder?

1094
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:05,621
No, my lubrication.

1095
01:14:05,621 --> 01:14:07,090
You're just so dry, Daric.

1096
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:09,292
Don't slam the
trunk either, man.

1097
01:14:16,099 --> 01:14:18,434
Hey, yo!
Motherfucker.

1098
01:14:18,434 --> 01:14:21,470
As we headed off to Vegas
for the decathlon nationals,

1099
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:23,606
Stephanie
was all I could think about.

1100
01:14:23,606 --> 01:14:27,977
I finally decided that there
were two things I could do--

1101
01:14:27,977 --> 01:14:30,279
go on agonizing over Stephanie,

1102
01:14:30,279 --> 01:14:33,282
or just say fuck it and have fun.

1103
01:15:13,857 --> 01:15:15,992
Vegas sucks.

1104
01:15:20,563 --> 01:15:22,331
Hey, turn that down.

1105
01:15:22,331 --> 01:15:24,934
The sound is the best part.

1106
01:15:24,934 --> 01:15:26,502
Oh, yeah!

1107
01:15:28,004 --> 01:15:32,741
Ben, Virgil,
I want you to meet Rachel.

1108
01:15:32,741 --> 01:15:34,577
Hey.
Hi.

1109
01:15:34,577 --> 01:15:35,845
You're Ben?

1110
01:15:35,845 --> 01:15:37,146
Yeah.

1111
01:15:37,146 --> 01:15:38,681
What are you studying?

1112
01:15:38,681 --> 01:15:40,583
Um... Econ.

1113
01:15:40,583 --> 01:15:42,952
Econ?
Yeah.

1114
01:15:44,353 --> 01:15:48,858
Brother, today
is your lucky day.

1115
01:15:48,858 --> 01:15:50,326
What?

1116
01:15:50,326 --> 01:15:51,460
Yeah!

1117
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:52,828
Whoo!

1118
01:15:52,828 --> 01:15:55,064
Go get 'em.

1119
01:16:05,741 --> 01:16:07,476
All right, sweetie,

1120
01:16:07,476 --> 01:16:09,078
here are the rules.

1121
01:16:09,078 --> 01:16:12,148
No kissing,
and I always lead.

1122
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:28,932
Come on, sweetie.

1123
01:16:55,058 --> 01:16:56,459
How was it?

1124
01:16:57,693 --> 01:16:59,795
How was it?

1125
01:16:59,795 --> 01:17:01,364
Oh, you bad, bad boy.

1126
01:17:01,364 --> 01:17:03,799
That is so disgusting, man.

1127
01:17:03,799 --> 01:17:05,268
Come on, man.

1128
01:17:05,268 --> 01:17:06,835
Actually, it was...

1129
01:17:06,835 --> 01:17:09,738
incredible.

1130
01:17:09,738 --> 01:17:13,176
I just couldn't believe
I had finally done it.

1131
01:17:13,176 --> 01:17:14,677
It was such a relief.

1132
01:17:14,677 --> 01:17:17,213
I had prayed every day
up until that moment

1133
01:17:17,213 --> 01:17:20,083
that I would have sex
before I died.

1134
01:17:29,725 --> 01:17:31,594
Thank you.

1135
01:17:31,594 --> 01:17:33,929
Dude, man, wasn't
she awesome?

1136
01:17:33,929 --> 01:17:35,698
Wasn't she awesome, man?

1137
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,501
Mmm...

1138
01:17:38,501 --> 01:17:41,504
Dude, what the fuck?

1139
01:17:41,504 --> 01:17:42,705
Here you go.

1140
01:17:42,705 --> 01:17:44,640
Fuck! God damn it!

1141
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:47,576
Your little friend
pulled a gun on me.

1142
01:17:47,576 --> 01:17:48,877
Calm down!

1143
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:50,613
Shut up, Virg!
Fuck you.

1144
01:17:50,613 --> 01:17:54,050
Look, this is more money
than we owe you.

1145
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:55,551
Fuck all of you.

1146
01:17:55,551 --> 01:17:57,020
What are you doing, Virg?
You crazy?

1147
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:58,354
She said she wanted
to play rough.

1148
01:17:58,354 --> 01:18:00,256
You want to play fucking rough?!

1149
01:18:00,256 --> 01:18:01,724
Stop it! 
Put the gun down!

1150
01:18:01,724 --> 01:18:03,559
I want to play rough.

1151
01:18:03,559 --> 01:18:06,429
Virgil, put the gun down.
Put the gun down.

1152
01:18:06,429 --> 01:18:08,064
Virgil, put the gun down.

1153
01:18:08,064 --> 01:18:12,435
What do you think now, hotshot?
Virg, put the gun down.

1154
01:18:15,304 --> 01:18:17,506
Get the fuck off me.

1155
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:34,157
The morning after
I lost my virginity,

1156
01:18:34,157 --> 01:18:36,325
we won the national title.

1157
01:18:51,274 --> 01:18:53,876
I don't sell that shit no more.

1158
01:18:53,876 --> 01:18:56,011
That's cool.

1159
01:18:59,882 --> 01:19:01,450
How have you been?

1160
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:03,552
Haven't seen you
since the... Formal.

1161
01:19:03,552 --> 01:19:05,754
Right.

1162
01:19:05,754 --> 01:19:06,889
Hey, by the way,

1163
01:19:06,889 --> 01:19:08,624
I never got a chance
to thank you

1164
01:19:08,624 --> 01:19:10,159
for taking Stephanie.

1165
01:19:11,427 --> 01:19:12,861
She said she had the best time.

1166
01:19:12,861 --> 01:19:15,498
Maybe you can take her
to all the school functions.

1167
01:19:15,498 --> 01:19:18,234
You should try it.
You might like it.

1168
01:19:19,802 --> 01:19:23,306
It's all a superficial,
bullshit waste of time.

1169
01:19:23,306 --> 01:19:25,141
Yeah, you mentioned that.

1170
01:19:25,141 --> 01:19:27,110
I have a proposition for you.

1171
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:29,612
Actually, for you
and your buddies.

1172
01:19:29,612 --> 01:19:32,115
Look, that's all in the past.

1173
01:19:34,717 --> 01:19:37,286
Listen, you guys are definitely
going to like this.

1174
01:19:37,286 --> 01:19:38,621
It's too sweet.

1175
01:19:38,621 --> 01:19:40,489
No, thanks.

1176
01:19:40,489 --> 01:19:43,792
Well, give me
the other guys' digits.

1177
01:19:47,996 --> 01:19:49,298
I thought we were friends.

1178
01:19:49,298 --> 01:19:52,268
That has nothing
to do with this.

1179
01:19:52,268 --> 01:19:54,537
There's going to be
a lot of money involved.

1180
01:19:54,537 --> 01:19:57,106
You already got all
the money you need.

1181
01:20:02,745 --> 01:20:04,680
Change.

1182
01:20:06,682 --> 01:20:08,651
I don't give a shit
about the cash.

1183
01:20:08,651 --> 01:20:10,586
It's what
we've been talking about.

1184
01:20:10,586 --> 01:20:12,488
It's time to break the cycle.

1185
01:20:12,488 --> 01:20:13,656
What?

1186
01:20:13,656 --> 01:20:17,626
Listen, this is going to better
everyone involved.

1187
01:20:17,626 --> 01:20:19,828
Just trust me.

1188
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,404
Ben, did he tell you

1189
01:20:28,404 --> 01:20:29,772
what this is all about?

1190
01:20:29,772 --> 01:20:32,175
No.

1191
01:20:36,445 --> 01:20:39,315
Fuckin' rich boy.

1192
01:20:41,450 --> 01:20:44,453
Let's talk outside.

1193
01:20:44,453 --> 01:20:46,389
Steve,
this is Virgil...

1194
01:20:46,389 --> 01:20:47,190
Hey.

1195
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:49,792
...and Han.

1196
01:20:49,792 --> 01:20:50,926
David, right?

1197
01:20:50,926 --> 01:20:52,195
Daric.

1198
01:20:52,195 --> 01:20:53,929
Sorry.

1199
01:20:53,929 --> 01:20:55,198
How's your stroke?

1200
01:20:55,198 --> 01:20:58,066
My stroke?

1201
01:20:59,335 --> 01:21:00,603
You guys want
something to drink?

1202
01:21:00,603 --> 01:21:01,937
Yeah, I'll take a beer.

1203
01:21:01,937 --> 01:21:03,071
Beer.

1204
01:21:03,071 --> 01:21:04,540
Okay.

1205
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:05,341
Have a seat.

1206
01:21:05,341 --> 01:21:07,743
I'll be right back.

1207
01:21:07,743 --> 01:21:10,446
What's up with that guy?
Stroke?

1208
01:21:10,446 --> 01:21:13,048
Hey, by the way, congrats
on winning the Nationals.

1209
01:21:13,048 --> 01:21:14,049
Thank you.

1210
01:21:14,049 --> 01:21:15,218
What happened to you guys?

1211
01:21:15,218 --> 01:21:16,552
Too many freshmen.

1212
01:21:16,552 --> 01:21:18,086
Their fuckin' brains froze
in the semis.

1213
01:21:18,086 --> 01:21:20,323
What are you going to do?

1214
01:21:22,057 --> 01:21:24,727
The streak had to end sometime.

1215
01:21:24,727 --> 01:21:26,929
So, why are we here?

1216
01:21:26,929 --> 01:21:29,665
You're looking at it.

1217
01:21:29,665 --> 01:21:32,601
What?

1218
01:21:32,601 --> 01:21:34,637
We do my parents' house.

1219
01:21:34,637 --> 01:21:38,541
Yo, that's fucked up.
Why?

1220
01:21:38,541 --> 01:21:40,943
It's none of your fuckin' business.

1221
01:21:40,943 --> 01:21:43,312
Okay.

1222
01:21:43,312 --> 01:21:44,780
Let's go, guys.

1223
01:21:46,482 --> 01:21:48,884
Everyone needs a wake-up call.

1224
01:21:51,153 --> 01:21:54,957
I love them.
That's why I'm doing this.

1225
01:21:54,957 --> 01:21:58,527
"I love them.
That's why I'm doing this."

1226
01:21:59,962 --> 01:22:01,830
That dude's fucked up.

1227
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:04,333
Let's do it.

1228
01:22:05,234 --> 01:22:06,835
Let's fuckin' do it.

1229
01:22:06,835 --> 01:22:07,770
No.

1230
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:09,638
No. We're not gonna rob anyone.

1231
01:22:09,638 --> 01:22:11,240
Everyone needs a wake-up call.

1232
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:12,541
That's what he said, right?

1233
01:22:12,541 --> 01:22:14,209
Let's fuckin'

1234
01:22:14,209 --> 01:22:15,378
give it to him.

1235
01:22:15,378 --> 01:22:16,979
Look, that shit is just weird.

1236
01:22:16,979 --> 01:22:18,247
Oh, yeah, it is.

1237
01:22:18,247 --> 01:22:20,383
We're gonna play along
for a while,

1238
01:22:20,383 --> 01:22:22,385
and then we're gonna teach
that fucker

1239
01:22:22,385 --> 01:22:23,952
a lesson.

1240
01:22:23,952 --> 01:22:28,190
Virg, don't you see the way
that guy talks to you?

1241
01:22:28,190 --> 01:22:33,128
That dude doesn't even think
you're on the same level.

1242
01:22:33,128 --> 01:22:35,398
Think about it.

1243
01:22:35,398 --> 01:22:37,099
What about you, Han?

1244
01:22:37,099 --> 01:22:39,902
That rich motherfucker wants
to punish his own family?

1245
01:22:39,902 --> 01:22:41,804
Why?

1246
01:22:41,804 --> 01:22:44,607
Because Mommy and Daddy won't
pay enough attention to him?

1247
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:49,612
And you.

1248
01:22:49,612 --> 01:22:52,147
He thinks

1249
01:22:52,147 --> 01:22:53,882
you're fuckin' dickless.

1250
01:22:53,882 --> 01:22:57,486
No? Well, why else
would he let you take

1251
01:22:57,486 --> 01:23:00,088
his girlfriend to the formal?

1252
01:23:00,088 --> 01:23:03,426
No. No!

1253
01:23:03,426 --> 01:23:06,161
We'll just rough 'em up
a little bit.

1254
01:23:06,161 --> 01:23:11,634
Mostly... we'll scare
the shit out of him.

1255
01:23:11,634 --> 01:23:14,303
Dude, this is brilliant.

1256
01:23:14,303 --> 01:23:17,072
After we fuckin'
beat the shit out of him,

1257
01:23:17,072 --> 01:23:18,407
we could turn him in
to the cops

1258
01:23:18,407 --> 01:23:20,108
for conspiring to rob
his own family.

1259
01:23:20,108 --> 01:23:21,377
Exactly.

1260
01:23:22,978 --> 01:23:24,380
Oh, yeah!

1261
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:25,714
Ooh.
Come on, guys.

1262
01:23:27,583 --> 01:23:29,251
I don't know.

1263
01:23:29,251 --> 01:23:31,654
Come on!
Let's do it!

1264
01:23:31,654 --> 01:23:33,322
Yeah.
It'll be fun.

1265
01:23:34,857 --> 01:23:36,592
All right, man,
I'm just doing this

1266
01:23:36,592 --> 01:23:38,394
so you don't fuck
this up, all right?

1267
01:23:38,394 --> 01:23:39,395
Yeah.

1268
01:23:39,395 --> 01:23:40,396
Yeah!

1269
01:23:42,064 --> 01:23:45,368
No, I can't.

1270
01:23:46,735 --> 01:23:50,072
This'll be our blueprint.

1271
01:23:50,072 --> 01:23:51,607
Let's start on page three.

1272
01:23:51,607 --> 01:23:53,208
By the way,
I'm going to need a gun.

1273
01:23:53,208 --> 01:23:55,478
I know. I'm working on it.

1274
01:23:55,478 --> 01:23:57,346
Can I get one of those
semiautomatics?

1275
01:23:57,346 --> 01:23:58,747
It'll cost you.

1276
01:23:58,747 --> 01:24:00,616
Just take it out of my share.

1277
01:24:00,616 --> 01:24:03,752
No. We'll need the
money up front.

1278
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:06,622
All right.

1279
01:24:06,622 --> 01:24:08,357
Just let me know how much.

1280
01:24:08,357 --> 01:24:10,092
No problem.

1281
01:24:10,092 --> 01:24:11,860
Steve was meticulous.

1282
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:14,363
He had mapped out each of
our paths for the robbery.

1283
01:24:14,363 --> 01:24:16,131
He made us do it
over and over

1284
01:24:16,131 --> 01:24:17,933
until he felt we got it.

1285
01:24:17,933 --> 01:24:21,103
I just don't know what
Stephanie found so attractive.

1286
01:24:21,103 --> 01:24:23,038
So...
At all!

1287
01:24:23,038 --> 01:24:24,840
...Han, you think
you can break in?

1288
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:25,974
Fuck, yeah.

1289
01:24:25,974 --> 01:24:26,775
That's it.

1290
01:24:26,775 --> 01:24:28,644
I can't handle it anymore.

1291
01:24:28,644 --> 01:24:31,246
I ain't going
to the meeting tomorrow.

1292
01:24:31,246 --> 01:24:32,948
Shut up!

1293
01:24:32,948 --> 01:24:36,251
Look, we all have to do it,
or it'll just fuck it all up.

1294
01:24:36,251 --> 01:24:39,455
Well, I still ain't going!

1295
01:24:39,455 --> 01:24:40,923
Dude, why?

1296
01:24:40,923 --> 01:24:43,025
'Cause Chrissy's throwin'
a party tomorrow.

1297
01:24:43,025 --> 01:24:44,660
Why don't we just
invite him to come?

1298
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:45,761
He's the one who said

1299
01:24:45,761 --> 01:24:48,363
we should get to know
each other.

1300
01:24:50,232 --> 01:24:51,767
Whatever.

1301
01:24:54,336 --> 01:24:56,304
You think he'll show?

1302
01:24:56,304 --> 01:24:57,506
Who cares, man?

1303
01:24:57,506 --> 01:24:59,442
At least we don't have to sit

1304
01:24:59,442 --> 01:25:01,043
through all that bullshit.

1305
01:25:01,043 --> 01:25:03,378
I can't wait till
this is all over.

1306
01:25:03,378 --> 01:25:04,780
You watch.

1307
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:07,049
It'll all be worth it.

1308
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:14,056
Be right back.

1309
01:25:21,296 --> 01:25:23,131
Hey, Steph.

1310
01:25:23,131 --> 01:25:24,933
Hey, Ben.

1311
01:25:27,135 --> 01:25:28,136
Where's Steve?

1312
01:25:28,136 --> 01:25:29,237
I don't know.

1313
01:25:29,237 --> 01:25:31,540
He told me to meet him here.

1314
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:33,141
He's on time as usual.

1315
01:25:34,276 --> 01:25:37,012
Hey.

1316
01:25:37,012 --> 01:25:39,281
Whoa. Is it real?

1317
01:25:39,281 --> 01:25:41,216
Just got it done this morning.

1318
01:25:41,216 --> 01:25:42,350
What does it mean?

1319
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:44,753
It's my Chinese name.

1320
01:25:44,753 --> 01:25:46,955
Why you guys hiding out
from everyone?

1321
01:25:46,955 --> 01:25:48,090
Hey.

1322
01:25:48,090 --> 01:25:49,825
Hey. Hello.

1323
01:25:49,825 --> 01:25:51,894
Hey.

1324
01:25:53,629 --> 01:25:56,164
Yo, D-Rock!

1325
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:03,839
Is that a new tattoo?

1326
01:26:03,839 --> 01:26:05,508
Yeah.

1327
01:26:05,508 --> 01:26:07,375
You gonna show me?

1328
01:26:07,375 --> 01:26:08,511
Later.

1329
01:26:08,511 --> 01:26:09,512
When did you get it?

1330
01:26:09,512 --> 01:26:11,514
This morning.

1331
01:26:11,514 --> 01:26:13,516
You all right?

1332
01:26:13,516 --> 01:26:14,983
Hey, Steph.
What up, man?

1333
01:26:14,983 --> 01:26:16,652
Hi.

1334
01:26:16,652 --> 01:26:18,120
What up, dude?

1335
01:26:19,054 --> 01:26:20,656
So this is where
the Asians hang out.

1336
01:26:20,656 --> 01:26:23,526
Yup. Library was closed.

1337
01:26:25,528 --> 01:26:26,795
Hey, you're a funny guy.

1338
01:26:28,130 --> 01:26:30,265
For an Oriental.

1339
01:26:30,265 --> 01:26:31,667
He's been drinking.

1340
01:26:32,935 --> 01:26:34,537
Hey, Daric, where you going
to go to college

1341
01:26:34,537 --> 01:26:35,804
next year, man?

1342
01:26:35,804 --> 01:26:37,540
I just turned in
my apps last month.

1343
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:38,807
What about you?

1344
01:26:38,807 --> 01:26:40,442
Ah, it'll be
an Ivy League for sure.

1345
01:26:40,442 --> 01:26:41,510
I don't know which yet.

1346
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:42,978
You already got in?

1347
01:26:42,978 --> 01:26:44,513
Yeah, of course.

1348
01:26:44,513 --> 01:26:45,914
You'll have to excuse Steve.

1349
01:26:45,914 --> 01:26:47,916
He gets cocky when he's drunk.

1350
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:49,918
Only when he's drunk?

1351
01:26:51,987 --> 01:26:53,656
Excuse me, guys.

1352
01:26:53,656 --> 01:26:55,791
Too much testosterone.

1353
01:26:55,791 --> 01:26:58,193
Did I say something?

1354
01:27:04,066 --> 01:27:08,537
So, this is like
the "I love Stephanie" fan club.

1355
01:27:08,537 --> 01:27:10,405
You know, Daric,
you're a pretty cool guy.

1356
01:27:10,405 --> 01:27:11,540
I can't believe Steph thought

1357
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:15,678
you were a stalker or something.

1358
01:27:15,678 --> 01:27:17,412
Yo, what'd you think
of her friend?

1359
01:27:17,412 --> 01:27:18,547
What friend?

1360
01:27:18,547 --> 01:27:20,415
The one she brought
to mini golf.

1361
01:27:20,415 --> 01:27:21,550
All right.

1362
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:25,420
Yeah. Isn't Steph the best?

1363
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:26,655
You want a drink?

1364
01:27:26,655 --> 01:27:28,423
Yeah,
whatever you get.

1365
01:27:28,423 --> 01:27:29,558
All right.

1366
01:27:29,558 --> 01:27:30,559
Ben?

1367
01:27:30,559 --> 01:27:31,960
I'm good.

1368
01:27:33,161 --> 01:27:34,429
Thanks, D-Rock.

1369
01:27:34,429 --> 01:27:37,299
Anytime, Stevie-boy.

1370
01:27:37,299 --> 01:27:39,067
Why you hang out
with him, Ben?

1371
01:27:39,067 --> 01:27:41,904
He's got something up his ass
all the time.

1372
01:27:41,904 --> 01:27:43,772
He's all right.

1373
01:27:45,641 --> 01:27:51,246
Yo... Steph's the one.

1374
01:27:51,246 --> 01:27:53,782
Steph's the one.

1375
01:27:53,782 --> 01:27:56,518
You were right.

1376
01:27:56,518 --> 01:27:58,887
She deserves to be treated better.

1377
01:27:58,887 --> 01:28:01,256
I'm going
to treat her better.

1378
01:28:01,256 --> 01:28:03,125
I owe it all to you, man.

1379
01:28:03,125 --> 01:28:05,060
Thank you.

1380
01:28:06,394 --> 01:28:07,663
Steve, you're wasted.

1381
01:28:07,663 --> 01:28:09,131
Thanks, man.

1382
01:28:09,131 --> 01:28:11,199
Okay. You're welcome.
You're welcome.

1383
01:28:12,668 --> 01:28:14,937
All right.

1384
01:28:14,937 --> 01:28:16,138
I'll be right back.

1385
01:28:16,138 --> 01:28:17,139
Okay.

1386
01:28:17,139 --> 01:28:18,140
All right.

1387
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:19,675
Thank you.

1388
01:28:30,152 --> 01:28:33,288
At that point,
by the look in Daric's eyes,

1389
01:28:33,288 --> 01:28:36,692
I knew it was on.

1390
01:28:38,894 --> 01:28:40,729
It was New Year's Eve.

1391
01:28:40,729 --> 01:28:42,597
Jesus said we could use
his house

1392
01:28:42,597 --> 01:28:44,166
if we paid him a hundred bucks.

1393
01:28:44,166 --> 01:28:46,769
His parents had left for Tahoe
a day earlier.

1394
01:28:46,769 --> 01:28:49,004
I still thought it was
a bad idea,

1395
01:28:49,004 --> 01:28:51,306
so the guys and I
made a compromise.

1396
01:28:51,306 --> 01:28:54,109
All I had to do
was be the lookout.

1397
01:28:54,109 --> 01:28:55,343
Hey.
Hey.

1398
01:28:55,343 --> 01:28:56,645
They're right around back
in the garage.

1399
01:28:56,645 --> 01:28:58,180
I'll be in there in a sec.

1400
01:29:03,652 --> 01:29:05,087
Fuck!

1401
01:29:09,925 --> 01:29:12,795
What's up, fellas?

1402
01:29:12,795 --> 01:29:14,930
So you got the cash?

1403
01:29:15,831 --> 01:29:17,465
Of course.

1404
01:29:17,465 --> 01:29:19,201
Got my gun?

1405
01:29:30,212 --> 01:29:31,346
This...

1406
01:29:31,346 --> 01:29:33,949
is your wake-up call.

1407
01:29:37,585 --> 01:29:39,487
For your mommy and daddy.

1408
01:29:48,496 --> 01:29:50,432
Fuck!

1409
01:29:50,432 --> 01:29:51,700
Get the gun!
Get the gun!

1410
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:53,101
Han, get the gun!

1411
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:55,203
Shit!

1412
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,135
Oh, God.

1413
01:30:05,972 --> 01:30:07,874
Fuck!

1414
01:30:10,709 --> 01:30:11,945
Don't!

1415
01:30:21,254 --> 01:30:22,355
Ben.

1416
01:30:22,355 --> 01:30:24,323
Ben.

1417
01:30:24,323 --> 01:30:26,359
Ben!

1418
01:30:57,156 --> 01:30:58,992
What the fuck?

1419
01:30:58,992 --> 01:31:01,160
We didn't agree to this.

1420
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:03,829
This is going to cost you extra.

1421
01:31:03,829 --> 01:31:07,766
We're going to have to get rid
of the body.

1422
01:31:07,766 --> 01:31:09,168
What do you mean?

1423
01:31:09,168 --> 01:31:11,370
Jesus, what about
your backyard?

1424
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:12,305
No way.

1425
01:31:12,305 --> 01:31:14,773
I promise no one
will ever know.

1426
01:31:14,773 --> 01:31:17,877
$300.

1427
01:31:22,615 --> 01:31:25,284
Come on, guys, dish it up.

1428
01:31:26,886 --> 01:31:28,621
Shit!

1429
01:31:28,621 --> 01:31:30,890
You guys got any money?

1430
01:31:30,890 --> 01:31:33,026
Virg?

1431
01:31:33,893 --> 01:31:35,461
Here. 150.

1432
01:31:35,461 --> 01:31:37,030
I'll get you the rest tomorrow,
all right?

1433
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:38,431
Fuck no.
You pay me now.

1434
01:31:48,174 --> 01:31:50,643
Here, three hundred.

1435
01:31:50,643 --> 01:31:52,778
Can I have
the wallet too?

1436
01:31:52,778 --> 01:31:55,048
Fuck!

1437
01:31:55,048 --> 01:31:57,183
Oh, shit.

1438
01:31:57,183 --> 01:31:59,919
He's still alive.

1439
01:32:08,661 --> 01:32:10,930
Someone hold him up.

1440
01:32:10,930 --> 01:32:13,466
Virg, please, hold him up.

1441
01:32:13,466 --> 01:32:15,134
It's going to be okay, Ben.

1442
01:32:15,134 --> 01:32:17,003
It's going to be just fine.

1443
01:32:21,207 --> 01:32:23,476
Oh, fuck.

1444
01:32:24,577 --> 01:32:26,045
You got him, Virg?

1445
01:32:26,045 --> 01:32:27,880
Yeah.
All right.

1446
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,282
Hold him up.
Hold his head up.

1447
01:32:29,282 --> 01:32:31,150
Hold it up. Tilt
it back, okay?
Okay.

1448
01:32:31,150 --> 01:32:32,685
Let me open his mouth.

1449
01:32:32,685 --> 01:32:33,786
All right.

1450
01:32:33,786 --> 01:32:34,988
It's going to be fine, Ben.

1451
01:32:34,988 --> 01:32:36,789
It's going to be just fine.

1452
01:32:36,789 --> 01:32:38,357
Oh, shit.

1453
01:32:38,357 --> 01:32:40,259
Just hold him down.
Just hold him down.

1454
01:32:40,259 --> 01:32:41,894
Christ!
Virg, it's okay.

1455
01:32:41,894 --> 01:32:43,196
Listen to me.
Just hang on, okay?

1456
01:32:43,196 --> 01:32:44,297
It'll be just fine.

1457
01:32:44,297 --> 01:32:45,898
Just hang on!
Just hang on to him!

1458
01:32:45,898 --> 01:32:47,900
Whatever you do!
I'm holding him!

1459
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:49,035
Jesus fucking Christ!

1460
01:32:49,035 --> 01:32:50,169
Just hang on!
Just hang on!

1461
01:32:50,169 --> 01:32:51,770
Whatever you do,
just hang on!

1462
01:32:54,173 --> 01:32:55,508
It's okay.
It'll be okay.

1463
01:32:55,508 --> 01:32:56,709
It'll be okay.

1464
01:32:56,709 --> 01:33:00,313
It'll be okay, Virg.
It'll be okay, Virg.

1465
01:33:00,313 --> 01:33:02,181
Okay, Virgil, just
a few more seconds.

1466
01:33:02,181 --> 01:33:03,916
Just breathe.

1467
01:33:03,916 --> 01:33:05,051
Just hang on!

1468
01:33:05,051 --> 01:33:06,719
Hang on.

1469
01:33:09,188 --> 01:33:11,724
Are you all right, Ben?

1470
01:33:16,195 --> 01:33:17,997
It's okay, man.

1471
01:33:19,999 --> 01:33:21,134
Shh. Shh.

1472
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:45,934
Ben.

1473
01:35:45,934 --> 01:35:48,070
Hey, Stephanie.

1474
01:35:48,070 --> 01:35:49,772
Hi.

1475
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:53,108
Happy New Year.

1476
01:35:53,108 --> 01:35:55,744
Happy New Year.

1477
01:35:55,744 --> 01:35:58,180
Are you okay?

1478
01:35:59,948 --> 01:36:01,617
I'm just mad at Steve.

1479
01:36:01,617 --> 01:36:04,253
For what?

1480
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,923
He totally stood me up.

1481
01:36:09,825 --> 01:36:12,361
I know he hates these things,
but still...

1482
01:36:12,361 --> 01:36:14,096
All right, everybody!

1483
01:36:14,096 --> 01:36:17,300
Let's get crazy!
It's almost New Year!

1484
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:18,901
Ten...
Ten, nine, eight...

1485
01:36:18,901 --> 01:36:22,405
I guess neither of us
are getting a kiss tonight, huh?

1486
01:36:22,405 --> 01:36:26,642
...five, four, three, two,

1487
01:36:26,642 --> 01:36:27,976
one!

1488
01:36:43,459 --> 01:36:44,660
I-I'm so sorry.

1489
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:45,994
I didn't mean to...
No.

1490
01:36:48,464 --> 01:36:52,335
Don't apologize.

1491
01:36:55,338 --> 01:36:57,706
I need to talk to Steve.

1492
01:37:00,343 --> 01:37:04,447
Uh, well, uh, guys are waiting.

1493
01:37:05,314 --> 01:37:06,982
Thanks, Ben.

1494
01:37:09,084 --> 01:37:11,687
Happy New Year.

1495
01:37:31,974 --> 01:37:33,609
Aw, shit.

1496
01:37:33,609 --> 01:37:35,344
Ben, will you take him
out of here?

1497
01:37:35,344 --> 01:37:36,345
Aw, fuck!

1498
01:37:36,345 --> 01:37:37,346
Fuck, man!

1499
01:37:37,346 --> 01:37:39,348
Get the fuck out
of here.

1500
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:44,086
Jesus, would you help us, please?

1501
01:37:44,086 --> 01:37:45,354
Fuck it.

1502
01:37:45,354 --> 01:37:48,223
Ah, Jesus.

1503
01:37:48,223 --> 01:37:49,725
You clean that shit up, man.

1504
01:38:24,693 --> 01:38:27,095
God damn, it's hot.

1505
01:38:30,599 --> 01:38:33,001
Are you done yet?

1506
01:38:35,369 --> 01:38:37,639
Early admissions?

1507
01:38:40,308 --> 01:38:42,310
Ivy Leaguers love it.

1508
01:38:42,310 --> 01:38:43,812
Gets 'em all wet.

1509
01:38:44,979 --> 01:38:47,115
All that studying
finally pays off,

1510
01:38:47,115 --> 01:38:50,218
and you get to leave
this hellhole a year early.

1511
01:38:59,027 --> 01:39:02,130
Damn, what is it,
like 95 degrees?

1512
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:05,433
Can't wait to go
to college, man.

1513
01:39:05,433 --> 01:39:06,968
It's like natural selection.

1514
01:39:06,968 --> 01:39:09,403
Every hot chick
you meet's got a brain.

1515
01:39:13,708 --> 01:39:15,710
Not mine.

1516
01:39:20,048 --> 01:39:21,249
Not mine.

1517
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:12,969
You never forget
the sight of a dead body

1518
01:40:12,969 --> 01:40:15,438
but then again,
I was experiencing

1519
01:40:15,438 --> 01:40:17,473
a lot of things
for the first time.

1520
01:40:17,473 --> 01:40:19,910
I guess it's just
part of growing up.

1521
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:44,135
I knew what I had to do.

1522
01:40:44,135 --> 01:40:46,003
Of course,
the right thing to do

1523
01:40:46,003 --> 01:40:49,073
was to call the police
and tell them everything.

1524
01:40:49,073 --> 01:40:53,611
It was right...
but it didn't mean it was easy.

1525
01:41:00,051 --> 01:41:01,886
Yo, Virg, I'm here.

1526
01:41:01,886 --> 01:41:03,755
Let's go, man.

1527
01:41:03,755 --> 01:41:05,423
Stop jerking off; let's go.

1528
01:41:07,659 --> 01:41:09,861
Yo, Virg,
stop fucking around, man.

1529
01:41:09,861 --> 01:41:11,496
Open the door.

1530
01:41:11,496 --> 01:41:15,132
Virg!
Open the fucking door, man!

1531
01:41:16,334 --> 01:41:17,502
I said open the door!

1532
01:41:17,502 --> 01:41:21,239
Virg! Open
the fucking door, Virg!

1533
01:41:21,239 --> 01:41:24,542
Virg! Virg!

1534
01:41:24,542 --> 01:41:27,011
Han said Virgil
had called him over

1535
01:41:27,011 --> 01:41:28,880
to watch some new porn.

1536
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:32,250
I guess Virg just didn't have
enough balls to do it alone.

1537
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:35,987
Open the fucking
door, Virg! Virg!

1538
01:41:35,987 --> 01:41:38,290
Fuck you, Virg!

1539
01:41:38,290 --> 01:41:40,858
Open this fucking door!

1540
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:52,134
So... what,

1541
01:41:52,134 --> 01:41:54,437
is he going to be retarded,
or something?

1542
01:41:54,437 --> 01:41:56,306
Ben, get him the
fuck out of here

1543
01:41:56,306 --> 01:41:57,707
before I kick his ass.

1544
01:42:01,043 --> 01:42:03,179
Come on, Daric.

1545
01:42:04,214 --> 01:42:06,349
Come on.

1546
01:42:18,228 --> 01:42:23,065
Wait, Ben, you think Virg
is going to talk?

1547
01:42:23,065 --> 01:42:27,169
No. What if he does?

1548
01:42:27,169 --> 01:42:28,604
Dude, what
are we going to do?

1549
01:42:29,972 --> 01:42:31,040
Nothing.

1550
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:33,876
Okay. Let me think.

1551
01:42:33,876 --> 01:42:37,780
Why did you write
that article about me?

1552
01:42:39,215 --> 01:42:40,483
What?

1553
01:42:40,483 --> 01:42:41,584
The newspaper article.

1554
01:42:41,584 --> 01:42:42,652
Why did you write it?

1555
01:42:42,652 --> 01:42:44,754
What are you talking
about, man?

1556
01:42:44,754 --> 01:42:46,889
I'm trying to 
fucking think here.

1557
01:42:48,057 --> 01:42:49,659
Wait.

1558
01:42:49,659 --> 01:42:52,295
Do you think Han
will be with us?

1559
01:42:54,297 --> 01:42:56,599
Later, Daric.

1560
01:43:09,011 --> 01:43:13,283
Ben... I'll call you later.

1561
01:45:05,327 --> 01:45:07,630
Nice.

1562
01:45:07,630 --> 01:45:09,699
You haven't seen
Steve, have you?

1563
01:45:09,699 --> 01:45:11,233
Steve?

1564
01:45:11,233 --> 01:45:12,868
Get in.

1565
01:45:19,775 --> 01:45:21,911
He's been gone
for a couple days,

1566
01:45:21,911 --> 01:45:23,879
and he's got everyone worried.

1567
01:45:25,881 --> 01:45:27,282
Are you worried?

1568
01:45:27,282 --> 01:45:32,054
Yeah, but you just never know
what Steve's up to.

1569
01:45:35,725 --> 01:45:38,260
Ben, thanks for putting
up with this.

1570
01:45:38,260 --> 01:45:39,562
What?

1571
01:45:39,562 --> 01:45:41,997
The whole thing
with me and Steve.

1572
01:45:46,235 --> 01:45:50,239
You know how you make decisions
that lead to other decisions?

1573
01:45:50,239 --> 01:45:52,007
Yeah.

1574
01:45:52,007 --> 01:45:54,376
Then you realize

1575
01:45:54,376 --> 01:45:56,512
you don't remember
why you made those decisions

1576
01:45:56,512 --> 01:45:57,847
in the first place.

1577
01:45:59,449 --> 01:46:01,417
Yeah.

1578
01:46:01,417 --> 01:46:03,052
When I saw you

1579
01:46:03,052 --> 01:46:05,154
on New Year's Eve,

1580
01:46:05,154 --> 01:46:07,823
I knew there was only one
right thing to do.

1581
01:46:57,873 --> 01:47:00,843
For the first time in my life,

1582
01:47:00,843 --> 01:47:03,078
I don't know
what my future will hold.

1583
01:47:03,078 --> 01:47:06,682
I don't even know what
the other guys are going to do.

1584
01:47:06,682 --> 01:47:08,283
All I know is that

1585
01:47:08,283 --> 01:47:10,686
there's no turning back.

1586
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:54,550
Just packed up a real money load,
and it's coming your way.

1587
01:47:54,637 --> 01:47:58,800
Look for "Rodgers" on the truck's side.
Don't forget my share of the deal.

1588
01:50:48,812 --> 01:50:49,393
Shit!

1589
01:51:30,730 --> 01:51:34,181
- Tuna on white, no crust, right?
- I don't know. How is it?

1590
01:51:34,859 --> 01:51:39,153
Every day, for the last three weeks,
you've come here, asking how the tuna is.

1591
01:51:39,238 --> 01:51:42,987
Now, it was crappy yesterday.
It was crappy the day before.

1592
01:51:43,075 --> 01:51:45,863
And guess what? It hasn't changed.

1593
01:51:46,496 --> 01:51:48,405
- I'll have the tuna.
- No crust?

1594
01:51:48,498 --> 01:51:49,577
No crust.

1595
01:52:13,815 --> 01:52:14,929
Thank you.

1596
01:53:01,988 --> 01:53:04,361
Talk to me, Jesse.
This ain't working, brother.

1597
01:53:04,449 --> 01:53:07,071
It's your fuel map. It's got a nasty hole.

1598
01:53:07,494 --> 01:53:10,246
- That's why you're unloading in third.
- Told you.

1599
01:53:10,330 --> 01:53:15,455
I lengthen the injector pulse a millisecond.
Just tune the NOS timer, you'll run nines.

1600
01:53:23,302 --> 01:53:25,923
What's up with this fool?
Is he sandwich-crazy?

1601
01:53:26,013 --> 01:53:30,639
- No. He ain't here for the food, dog.
- Chill out. He's slinging parts for Harry.

1602
01:53:30,726 --> 01:53:34,225
- I know what he's slinging.
- He's trying to get in Mia's pants, dog.

1603
01:53:34,313 --> 01:53:36,555
- What's up, guys?
- How you doing, Mia?

1604
01:53:36,648 --> 01:53:38,807
- How you living, girl?
- Hey!

1605
01:53:39,401 --> 01:53:41,809
Hey, Dom. You want something to drink?

1606
01:53:52,831 --> 01:53:55,951
- He's beautiful.
- I like his haircut.

1607
01:53:58,671 --> 01:53:59,702
Vince!

1608
01:54:00,965 --> 01:54:02,957
- What?
- Can I get you anything?

1609
01:54:04,718 --> 01:54:05,999
You look good.

1610
01:54:10,182 --> 01:54:12,852
- Thanks a lot, Mia. See you tomorrow.
- Sure.

1611
01:54:15,771 --> 01:54:17,728
- Tomorrow?
- I love this part.

1612
01:54:22,486 --> 01:54:27,113
Try Fatburger from now on. Get yourself a
Double Cheese with fries for $2.95, faggot.

1613
01:54:27,199 --> 01:54:30,699
- I like the tuna here.
- Bullshit. No one likes the tuna here.

1614
01:54:30,786 --> 01:54:32,197
Yeah, well, I do.

1615
01:54:44,717 --> 01:54:48,252
Jesus Christ, Dom! Would you get out
there? I'm sick of this shit.

1616
01:54:48,346 --> 01:54:50,671
I'm not kidding, Dom. Get out there!

1617
01:54:55,061 --> 01:54:57,552
- What did you put in that sandwich?
- That's funny.

1618
01:54:57,647 --> 01:54:59,853
- Dom!
- All right.

1619
01:55:18,376 --> 01:55:21,247
- Hey, man. He was in my face.
- I'm in your face.

1620
01:55:22,881 --> 01:55:25,798
Relax! Don't push it! You embarrass me!

1621
01:55:28,470 --> 01:55:29,750
Get over there!

1622
01:55:31,264 --> 01:55:33,055
Jesse, give me the wallet.

1623
01:55:35,935 --> 01:55:39,304
"Brian Earl Spilner."
Sounds like a serial killer name.

1624
01:55:39,439 --> 01:55:41,230
- Is that what you are?
- No, man.

1625
01:55:41,316 --> 01:55:43,273
Don't come around here again.

1626
01:55:45,695 --> 01:55:47,604
Hey, man. This is bullshit.

1627
01:55:48,657 --> 01:55:51,657
- You work for Harry, right?
- Yeah. I just started.

1628
01:55:51,868 --> 01:55:53,410
You were just fired.

1629
01:56:06,341 --> 01:56:09,461
Hey, Dominic.
I appreciate what you did, in a big way.

1630
01:56:09,970 --> 01:56:11,464
Dominic, I owe you.

1631
01:56:13,390 --> 01:56:17,933
Brian, you're messing with my business.
When Dominic drives, he's golden.

1632
01:56:18,061 --> 01:56:22,688
Kids pour in. They want everything he has.
Every performance part. They pay cash!

1633
01:56:23,233 --> 01:56:25,985
- What did Dominic say?
- You don't want to know.

1634
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:29,190
- What did Dominic say?
- He wants you out of here.

1635
01:56:29,781 --> 01:56:31,739
- He wants me out of here?
- Yes.

1636
01:56:31,825 --> 01:56:35,111
- And what did you say to Dom?
- What do you think I said?

1637
01:56:35,412 --> 01:56:37,903
I told him, "Good help is hard to find."

1638
01:56:41,084 --> 01:56:42,116
Relax.

1639
01:56:45,798 --> 01:56:47,043
I need NOS.

1640
01:56:47,591 --> 01:56:49,797
- I need NOS.
- No.

1641
01:56:49,968 --> 01:56:52,756
My car topped out at 140 miles per hour,
this morning.

1642
01:56:52,846 --> 01:56:57,259
Amateurs don't use nitrous oxide. I've
seen how you drive. You've a heavy foot.

1643
01:56:58,060 --> 01:57:01,180
- You'll blow yourself to pieces.
- I need one of these.

1644
01:57:01,438 --> 01:57:04,807
One of the big ones.
Actually, let's make it two.

1645
01:57:05,317 --> 01:57:07,476
And, Harry, I need it by tonight.

1646
01:58:19,267 --> 01:58:22,552
Hold up, hold up.
Look at this snowman right here, man.

1647
01:58:26,899 --> 01:58:29,735
Sweet ride.
What you running under there, man?

1648
01:58:32,488 --> 01:58:35,359
- Going to make me find out the hard way?
- Hell, yeah.

1649
01:58:35,450 --> 01:58:38,320
You brave. You brave.
They call me Hector.

1650
01:58:38,953 --> 01:58:41,741
I got a last name, too,
but I can't pronounce it.

1651
01:58:41,831 --> 01:58:44,287
- Brian Spilner.
- Typical white-boy name.

1652
01:58:44,626 --> 01:58:46,499
Know what I'm saying?

1653
01:58:48,797 --> 01:58:53,672
See that over there? That's mine.
My baby. I ain't cutting her loose tonight.

1654
01:58:53,968 --> 01:58:55,795
- Why not?
- I'm going legit, homey.

1655
01:58:55,887 --> 01:58:58,556
Trying to get on the NIRA circuit.
Heard about that?

1656
01:58:58,640 --> 01:59:01,641
- Hell, yeah.
- So, what's up with you, man?

1657
01:59:01,851 --> 01:59:06,015
- I'm just waiting for Toretto.
- Shit. Better get in line. This yours?

1658
01:59:07,190 --> 01:59:09,681
- I'm standing next to it.
- That's funny.

1659
01:59:09,818 --> 01:59:12,487
You know,
Edwin happens to know a few things.

1660
01:59:14,656 --> 01:59:16,862
And one of the things Edwin knows is:
It's not how you stand by your car...

1661
01:59:17,284 --> 01:59:20,201
...it's how you race your car.
You better learn that.

1662
01:59:26,168 --> 01:59:29,085
Oh, shit. Here they come. It's on.

1663
01:59:44,478 --> 01:59:46,269
- Dom.
- Marvin.

1664
01:59:47,981 --> 01:59:51,564
- Hey, Dom. How you doing?
- Hey, Camille. You been doing yoga?

1665
01:59:55,948 --> 01:59:58,865
You did? Of course you did. Monica.

1666
02:00:01,745 --> 02:00:03,738
I smell skanks.

1667
02:00:04,456 --> 02:00:08,324
Why don't you girls pack it up,
before I leave tread marks on your face?

1668
02:00:08,419 --> 02:00:09,332
Okay.

1669
02:00:09,586 --> 02:00:12,256
- Letty, I was just talking.
- Yeah. Whatever.

1670
02:00:12,673 --> 02:00:15,674
- Okay, Hector.
- Yeah? What's up, man?

1671
02:00:17,386 --> 02:00:18,928
- Yo. What's up?
- Edwin.

1672
02:00:19,013 --> 02:00:21,385
- How we doing this tonight?
- One race.

1673
02:00:21,890 --> 02:00:26,019
$2,000 buy-in. Winner takes all.
Hector, you're going to hold the cash.

1674
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:29,521
- Why Hector?
- Too slow to make away with the money.

1675
02:00:31,984 --> 02:00:34,653
- Okay. Good luck, guys.
- Hey, wait. Hold up.

1676
02:00:35,154 --> 02:00:39,021
I don't have any cash.
But I do have the pink slip to my car.

1677
02:00:39,492 --> 02:00:43,324
You just can't climb in the ring with Ali,
'cause you think you box.

1678
02:00:43,537 --> 02:00:46,787
He knows I can box. Check it out.
It's like this.

1679
02:00:47,792 --> 02:00:50,911
I lose, the winner takes my car.
Clean and clear.

1680
02:00:51,337 --> 02:00:54,706
But if I win, I take the cash,
and I take the respect.

1681
02:00:55,341 --> 02:00:56,372
Respect.

1682
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:01,091
To some people, that's more important.

1683
02:01:03,224 --> 02:01:04,552
That your car?

1684
02:01:08,354 --> 02:01:13,182
I see a cool air intake. It's got a NOS
fogger system and a T 4 turbo, Dominic.

1685
02:01:13,359 --> 02:01:18,317
I see an AIC controller.
It has direct port nitrous injection.

1686
02:01:18,573 --> 02:01:21,360
Yeah. And a stand-alone
fuel management system.

1687
02:01:22,368 --> 02:01:24,444
Not a bad way to spend $10,000.

1688
02:01:27,457 --> 02:01:28,915
You see that shit?

1689
02:01:29,792 --> 02:01:33,078
He's got enough NOS in there
to blow himself up. Period.

1690
02:01:34,005 --> 02:01:37,172
- So, what do you say? Am I worthy?
- We don't know yet.

1691
02:01:37,884 --> 02:01:39,675
But you're in. Let's go.

1692
02:01:40,553 --> 02:01:42,095
- All right.
- Let's go!

1693
02:02:46,536 --> 02:02:50,368
- What the hell is going on around here?
- Street's closed, pizza boy.

1694
02:02:50,874 --> 02:02:53,792
- Find another way home.
- Goddamn street racers.

1695
02:02:54,544 --> 02:02:58,838
<i>Log on, 22. Code 3. Tension is high.
They've blocked the street.</i>

1696
02:03:45,012 --> 02:03:46,387
Edwin.

1697
02:03:47,932 --> 02:03:50,886
This is yours, whether you win or lose.

1698
02:03:51,769 --> 02:03:54,390
But if you win, you get her, too.

1699
02:04:03,906 --> 02:04:05,448
You're going to win.

1700
02:04:06,826 --> 02:04:08,403
I'm going to win.

1701
02:04:52,789 --> 02:04:55,659
<i>We had a reported homicide.
187, at Barabian Liquors.</i>

1702
02:04:55,750 --> 02:05:00,127
I've got a 187 in Glendale.
Cops are all over it. We're good to roll.

1703
02:05:00,839 --> 02:05:02,249
- All right.
- Let's race!

1704
02:05:02,340 --> 02:05:03,371
Right.

1705
02:05:13,143 --> 02:05:13,925
Go!

1706
02:05:28,074 --> 02:05:29,189
Hell, yeah!

1707
02:05:45,258 --> 02:05:46,883
Damn, that guy's fast.

1708
02:05:55,060 --> 02:05:57,218
Let's go! Ménage!

1709
02:06:24,256 --> 02:06:27,043
No! Monica!

1710
02:06:42,816 --> 02:06:44,275
Shut up!

1711
02:07:38,998 --> 02:07:40,492
Well done, baby!

1712
02:07:49,884 --> 02:07:51,793
Come on. Come on. Back up.

1713
02:07:52,595 --> 02:07:55,929
Here's what you won, right here.
There you go.

1714
02:07:56,015 --> 02:07:58,886
You were racing a bunch of skateboards.
Know what I mean?

1715
02:08:00,311 --> 02:08:02,981
My sister holds the money. Count it.

1716
02:08:06,025 --> 02:08:07,603
And you're my trophy.

1717
02:08:10,864 --> 02:08:14,813
- Hey, Monica. What's up, baby?
- What's your problem? You didn't win.

1718
02:08:17,787 --> 02:08:19,068
Fuck you then!

1719
02:08:32,385 --> 02:08:33,666
Was that fun?

1720
02:08:33,887 --> 02:08:35,796
Got a problem there, buddy?

1721
02:08:42,520 --> 02:08:45,771
- What are you smiling about?
- Dude. I almost had you.

1722
02:08:48,610 --> 02:08:50,401
You almost had me?

1723
02:08:51,071 --> 02:08:53,526
You never had me.
You never had your car.

1724
02:08:56,827 --> 02:08:59,993
Granny-shifting.
Not double-clutching, like you should.

1725
02:09:00,914 --> 02:09:05,078
You're lucky that 100-shot of NOS
didn't blow the welds on the intake.

1726
02:09:06,336 --> 02:09:10,714
- Almost had me?
- You tell him, Dominic. Get out of here.

1727
02:09:12,092 --> 02:09:15,176
Now, me and the mad scientist
got to rip apart the block...

1728
02:09:15,262 --> 02:09:17,835
...and replace the piston rings you fried.

1729
02:09:25,606 --> 02:09:27,645
Ask any racer. Any real racer.

1730
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:32,861
It don't matter if you win by an inch
or a mile. Winning's winning.

1731
02:09:33,155 --> 02:09:34,483
Yeah!

1732
02:09:40,079 --> 02:09:43,163
<i>All available units,
we have street-racing along Hawthorne....</i>

1733
02:09:43,248 --> 02:09:45,158
Oh, shit! We got cops. Cops!

1734
02:09:45,459 --> 02:09:46,704
Go!

1735
02:09:58,430 --> 02:10:00,222
Cops! Get in the car! Go!

1736
02:11:24,476 --> 02:11:26,682
<i>Toretto, stop right there!</i>

1737
02:11:28,396 --> 02:11:29,511
<i>Toretto!</i>

1738
02:11:44,537 --> 02:11:45,736
Get in!

1739
02:12:32,252 --> 02:12:35,586
You're the last person in the world
I expected to show up.

1740
02:12:36,757 --> 02:12:40,671
I thought if I got in your good graces,
you might let me keep my car.

1741
02:12:40,928 --> 02:12:44,261
You are in my good graces,
but you ain't keeping your car.

1742
02:12:45,140 --> 02:12:48,141
You drive like you've done this before.
Are you a wheelman?

1743
02:12:48,227 --> 02:12:50,599
- No.
- You boost cars?

1744
02:12:53,023 --> 02:12:55,182
- No. Never.
- Ever done time?

1745
02:12:55,567 --> 02:12:57,893
Couple of overnighters. No big deal.

1746
02:12:58,654 --> 02:13:01,690
What about the two years
in juvie for boosting cars?

1747
02:13:04,660 --> 02:13:06,154
Tucson, right?

1748
02:13:06,870 --> 02:13:09,955
I had Jesse run a profile on you,
Brian Earl Spilner.

1749
02:13:11,500 --> 02:13:14,667
He'll find anything on the Web.
Anything about anybody.

1750
02:13:15,379 --> 02:13:16,790
So, why bullshit?

1751
02:13:18,507 --> 02:13:20,001
So, what about you?

1752
02:13:22,470 --> 02:13:23,964
Two years in Lompoc.

1753
02:13:27,016 --> 02:13:28,807
I'll die before I go back.

1754
02:13:34,940 --> 02:13:36,933
- Oh, great.
- What?

1755
02:13:39,862 --> 02:13:42,234
It's going to be a long-ass night.
That's what.

1756
02:13:46,536 --> 02:13:47,911
Follow us.

1757
02:14:38,630 --> 02:14:42,841
I thought we had an agreement.
You stay away. I stay away.

1758
02:14:44,260 --> 02:14:45,885
Everybody stays happy.

1759
02:14:46,012 --> 02:14:48,337
We got lost.
What do you want me to tell you?

1760
02:14:48,431 --> 02:14:51,349
- Who's "we?"
- My new mechanic.

1761
02:14:51,726 --> 02:14:53,553
Brian, meet Johnny Tran.

1762
02:14:53,687 --> 02:14:56,688
The guy in the snakeskin pants.
That's his cousin. Lance.

1763
02:14:56,773 --> 02:15:00,474
So, when are you going to give me a shot
at that Honda 2000 of yours?

1764
02:15:00,569 --> 02:15:02,976
- This your ride?
- It was. It's his now.

1765
02:15:03,405 --> 02:15:05,896
No, it's not. I haven't taken delivery.

1766
02:15:08,076 --> 02:15:11,777
Then, it's nobody's car.
But somebody put in the wrench time.

1767
02:15:14,833 --> 02:15:18,451
- What do you think, Lance?
- It's an amazing machine.

1768
02:15:19,129 --> 02:15:20,588
Yes, indeed.

1769
02:15:22,799 --> 02:15:24,210
Let's go.

1770
02:15:26,386 --> 02:15:30,799
I'll see you in the desert next month.
Be ready to have your ass handed to you.

1771
02:15:31,058 --> 02:15:34,925
- You'll need more than that crotch rocket.
- I got something for you.

1772
02:15:48,826 --> 02:15:52,360
- What the hell was that all about?
- Long story. I'll tell you later.

1773
02:15:52,454 --> 02:15:54,079
Let's get out of here.

1774
02:16:21,483 --> 02:16:22,598
NOS!

1775
02:16:34,789 --> 02:16:38,205
- So, what the hell was that all about?
- It's a long story.

1776
02:16:39,085 --> 02:16:40,994
Well, we got a 20-mile hike. Humor me.

1777
02:16:42,004 --> 02:16:44,127
A business deal that went sour.

1778
02:16:45,091 --> 02:16:48,175
Plus, I made the mistake
of sleeping with his sister.

1779
02:17:14,370 --> 02:17:15,615
Take care.

1780
02:17:20,710 --> 02:17:22,252
Yo, Spilner.

1781
02:17:23,671 --> 02:17:25,878
- You want a beer?
- Yeah, sure.

1782
02:17:26,549 --> 02:17:28,127
Oh, shit.

1783
02:17:52,200 --> 02:17:55,154
We were all there, right? Falling behind.

1784
02:17:55,245 --> 02:17:57,700
- With all that nitrous.
- Yeah.

1785
02:18:04,587 --> 02:18:08,039
Yo, Dom. We were just about to go
looking for you, brother.

1786
02:18:13,972 --> 02:18:15,252
Where were you?

1787
02:18:15,348 --> 02:18:19,595
There were mass cops there. They came in
from every direction. It was orchestrated.

1788
02:18:19,686 --> 02:18:22,058
- This your beer?
- Yeah, that's my beer.

1789
02:18:25,150 --> 02:18:27,641
Yo, Einstein. Take it upstairs.

1790
02:18:28,320 --> 02:18:30,858
You can't detail a car with the cover on.

1791
02:18:31,698 --> 02:18:34,569
- Can't even get that right.
- You all right?

1792
02:18:36,745 --> 02:18:39,616
- Am I all right?
- It was just a question.

1793
02:18:43,377 --> 02:18:44,657
Yo, Dom.

1794
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:49,000
- Why did you bring the buster here?
- 'Cause he kept me out of handcuffs!

1795
02:18:49,258 --> 02:18:53,090
He didn't just run back to the fort!
The buster brought me back.

1796
02:18:58,976 --> 02:19:02,724
You can have any brew you want,
as long as it's a Corona.

1797
02:19:03,397 --> 02:19:06,018
- Thanks, man.
- That's Vince's. So, enjoy it.

1798
02:19:08,026 --> 02:19:09,271
You.

1799
02:19:16,410 --> 02:19:20,490
- Hey, bro. You got a bathroom?
- Upstairs. First door on the right.

1800
02:19:36,722 --> 02:19:40,138
He's got no call being up in here.
You don't know that fool for shit.

1801
02:19:40,226 --> 02:19:43,725
- He's right, Dom.
- There was a time when I didn't know you.

1802
02:19:43,896 --> 02:19:45,805
That was in the third grade!

1803
02:19:49,026 --> 02:19:52,526
- Yeah. So, what girls are here?
- You name it. You want mine?

1804
02:19:52,613 --> 02:19:55,021
- You need to shut the....
- You want two?

1805
02:19:55,241 --> 02:19:57,910
- You don't have anything?
- You look a bit tired.

1806
02:19:57,994 --> 02:20:00,781
I think you should go upstairs
and give me a massage.

1807
02:20:00,871 --> 02:20:04,240
- Look at all our guests.
- How about you give me a massage?

1808
02:20:07,587 --> 02:20:09,045
Crazy lady.

1809
02:20:16,721 --> 02:20:19,390
You know you owe me
a 10-second car, right?

1810
02:20:24,020 --> 02:20:25,300
Oh, shit.

1811
02:20:31,069 --> 02:20:32,693
Did you wipe the seat?

1812
02:20:35,948 --> 02:20:39,318
Jesus Christ! Would you cut this shit?
Come on!

1813
02:20:41,415 --> 02:20:46,643
- Come on. Let's go get me a drink.
- We were just about to get along.

1814
02:20:53,508 --> 02:20:56,675
- So, what do you want?
- Anything, as long as it's cold.

1815
02:20:58,304 --> 02:21:01,887
You know, my brother likes you.
He usually doesn't like anybody.

1816
02:21:01,975 --> 02:21:05,225
- He's a complicated guy.
- Yeah? What about you?

1817
02:21:08,440 --> 02:21:10,765
- I'm simpler.
- You're a shitty liar.

1818
02:21:12,485 --> 02:21:14,811
Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

1819
02:21:16,489 --> 02:21:19,159
- But there's a problem.
- What's that?

1820
02:21:19,242 --> 02:21:21,449
You need to get some sleep.

1821
02:21:22,037 --> 02:21:25,986
And you definitely,
definitely need a shower.

1822
02:21:26,958 --> 02:21:29,247
Come on. I'll take you home.

1823
02:21:51,066 --> 02:21:53,983
<i>Show me your hands.
Very good. Now open the door.</i>

1824
02:21:54,486 --> 02:21:57,606
<i>Put your hands on your head.
Behind your head.</i>

1825
02:21:58,156 --> 02:22:01,739
<i>Face the front of the vehicle,
walk backwards towards the rear.</i>

1826
02:22:01,952 --> 02:22:05,321
<i>Take two steps to your right.
Stop right there.</i>

1827
02:22:08,375 --> 02:22:12,325
- What did I do?
- Shut up. He's clean, Sarge.

1828
02:22:23,098 --> 02:22:25,424
Damn!
Muse, will you take these things off?

1829
02:22:25,517 --> 02:22:28,435
- Shit. You put them on so tight.
- I like realism.

1830
02:22:29,063 --> 02:22:31,388
You never know who's watching, Brian.

1831
02:22:35,694 --> 02:22:39,478
Nice crib, Sergeant. It's a lot nicer
than the last place you confiscated.

1832
02:22:39,573 --> 02:22:43,785
Ain't it? Eddie Fisher built this house
for Elizabeth Taylor in the '50s.

1833
02:22:43,953 --> 02:22:46,870
You see, even the cops
are Hollywood in Hollywood.

1834
02:22:50,626 --> 02:22:53,960
Okay, here he is,
fresh from Toretto's hot rod heaven.

1835
02:22:54,046 --> 02:22:56,371
That was an $80,000 vehicle, Officer.

1836
02:22:56,465 --> 02:22:58,672
- You told him what happened?
- He knows.

1837
02:22:58,759 --> 02:23:02,674
- Send the bill to Johnny Tran.
- The kid's giving me attitude?

1838
02:23:02,763 --> 02:23:05,515
It doesn't speak well
for police/FBI relations, Tanner.

1839
02:23:05,599 --> 02:23:09,218
- I walk in the door and the guy's already--
- All right, all right.

1840
02:23:09,312 --> 02:23:11,518
We'll talk, okay? Let's talk about it.

1841
02:23:11,606 --> 02:23:14,891
Muse, why don't you make us
four iced cappuccinos, please?

1842
02:23:14,984 --> 02:23:17,309
- Come on.
- Regular or decaf, Sarge?

1843
02:23:18,905 --> 02:23:20,315
Decaf, I think.

1844
02:23:20,656 --> 02:23:23,361
Four hijackings in two months,
and we have nothing.

1845
02:23:23,451 --> 02:23:26,535
The DVD players and digital cameras
are worth $1.2 million...

1846
02:23:26,621 --> 02:23:29,408
...which brings the grand total
to $6 million plus.

1847
02:23:29,499 --> 02:23:32,334
We're in the political crosshairs now, Brian.

1848
02:23:33,086 --> 02:23:34,912
That's why you're undercover.

1849
02:23:35,004 --> 02:23:38,954
You want that detective badge fast, kid.
And you want to know something?

1850
02:23:39,300 --> 02:23:42,135
The FBI can help,
if you come through for us.

1851
02:23:43,179 --> 02:23:45,136
What does the truckdriver say?

1852
02:23:45,223 --> 02:23:48,758
He gave us the same M.O.:
Three Honda Civics, precision driving...

1853
02:23:48,851 --> 02:23:51,805
...the same green neon glow
from under the chassis.

1854
02:23:51,896 --> 02:23:56,357
Lab says the skid marks came back
the same: Mashimoto ZX tires.

1855
02:23:56,442 --> 02:23:59,147
So, we know it's somebody
in the street-racing world.

1856
02:23:59,237 --> 02:24:03,698
If we don't make this case, the truckers
will take matters into their own hands.

1857
02:24:03,783 --> 02:24:05,491
I tell them we're close.

1858
02:24:06,703 --> 02:24:08,612
Are you going to make me a liar?

1859
02:24:08,705 --> 02:24:10,247
Look, what do we know?

1860
02:24:10,331 --> 02:24:12,822
We know this world
revolves around Toretto, right?

1861
02:24:12,917 --> 02:24:16,002
I'm not saying that he's the one
that's popping these trucks...

1862
02:24:16,087 --> 02:24:20,417
...but I can guarantee he knows who is.
It's just a matter of time until I win--

1863
02:24:20,508 --> 02:24:24,458
You want time, buy the magazine.
We don't have time.

1864
02:24:26,264 --> 02:24:28,340
Just get me something I can use.

1865
02:24:30,185 --> 02:24:31,845
Is Harry cooperating?

1866
02:24:31,937 --> 02:24:35,519
Like a guy that'll do time
for receiving stolen property if he doesn't.

1867
02:24:35,607 --> 02:24:37,730
What kind of vibe
is he getting from Toretto?

1868
02:24:37,817 --> 02:24:40,937
He's scared of him,
but he doesn't think he's jacking trucks.

1869
02:24:41,029 --> 02:24:43,401
- He's too controlled for that.
- Wait.

1870
02:24:43,490 --> 02:24:46,610
Not that I want to contradict
Harry's fine judge of character...

1871
02:24:46,701 --> 02:24:50,236
...but Toretto did hard time
for nearly beating a guy to death.

1872
02:24:50,330 --> 02:24:53,450
He's got nitrous oxide in his blood
and a gas tank for a brain.

1873
02:24:53,542 --> 02:24:55,451
Do not turn your back on him.

1874
02:24:55,877 --> 02:24:57,420
Tanner, I'm gonna need another car.

1875
02:25:02,968 --> 02:25:05,375
- What about parts and service?
- Hold off on it.

1876
02:25:05,470 --> 02:25:07,796
Dom, I don't know what to do with it.

1877
02:25:10,893 --> 02:25:14,725
All right, what the hell is this?
What do you got there?

1878
02:25:16,481 --> 02:25:18,889
- This is your car.
- My car?

1879
02:25:19,526 --> 02:25:22,480
I said a 10-second car, not a 10-minute car.

1880
02:25:22,571 --> 02:25:26,403
You could push this across the finish line,
or tow it.

1881
02:25:27,701 --> 02:25:30,619
You couldn't even tow that
across the finish line.

1882
02:25:31,372 --> 02:25:32,570
No faith.

1883
02:25:32,664 --> 02:25:35,072
I have faith in you,
but this isn't a junkyard.

1884
02:25:35,167 --> 02:25:37,409
- This is a garage.
- Pop the hood.

1885
02:25:37,711 --> 02:25:38,956
- Pop the hood?
- Pop the hood.

1886
02:25:42,091 --> 02:25:45,756
- 2JZ engine. No shit.
- And what did I tell you?

1887
02:25:45,844 --> 02:25:48,596
- I retract my previous statement.
- You know what?

1888
02:25:48,681 --> 02:25:53,259
This will decimate all
after you put about $15,000 in it.

1889
02:25:53,352 --> 02:25:57,101
Or more,
if we have to overnight parts from Japan.

1890
02:25:57,565 --> 02:26:00,269
- We'll put it on my tab at Harry's.
- Yes!

1891
02:26:00,693 --> 02:26:04,477
I gotta get you racing again
so I can make some money off your ass.

1892
02:26:05,030 --> 02:26:07,735
There's a show down in the desert
called Race Wars.

1893
02:26:07,825 --> 02:26:10,114
That's where you'll do it.

1894
02:26:10,494 --> 02:26:13,828
When you're not working at Harry's,
you're working here.

1895
02:26:14,081 --> 02:26:17,830
If you can't find the right tool
in this garage, Mr. Arizona...

1896
02:26:19,170 --> 02:26:20,415
...you don't belong near a car.

1897
02:26:24,008 --> 02:26:25,383
He owns you now.

1898
02:26:52,704 --> 02:26:54,495
Tell me what you think about this.
Koni adjustables.

1899
02:26:55,331 --> 02:26:57,538
Gonna save us about 2 pounds.

1900
02:26:57,750 --> 02:27:01,084
And they're gonna give us
better traction for the hole shot.

1901
02:27:01,170 --> 02:27:02,415
All right?

1902
02:27:03,256 --> 02:27:05,332
This is your basic layout of the car.

1903
02:27:05,425 --> 02:27:09,257
And that's pretty much
what it could look like when it's finished.

1904
02:27:10,013 --> 02:27:11,388
Red, green.

1905
02:27:12,015 --> 02:27:15,550
- You should be going to MIT or something.
- Yeah, right.

1906
02:27:16,227 --> 02:27:19,062
No, I got that.... What's it called?

1907
02:27:20,148 --> 02:27:22,306
That attention disorder--

1908
02:27:22,400 --> 02:27:26,101
- ADD?
- Yes, that shit. Yeah.

1909
02:27:27,238 --> 02:27:31,153
You know, I was good in algebra
and like math and shit.

1910
02:27:31,993 --> 02:27:35,742
Everything else I failed.
Dropped out of school.

1911
02:27:36,623 --> 02:27:39,743
I don't know.
It's just something about engines...

1912
02:27:39,834 --> 02:27:42,954
...that calms me down, you know.

1913
02:28:03,817 --> 02:28:06,273
- I'm outta here.
- Come on, dog.

1914
02:28:06,903 --> 02:28:09,573
- Yo, Dom.
- Vince, get over here and give us a hand.

1915
02:28:09,656 --> 02:28:12,574
Looks like you got
all the help you need, brother.

1916
02:28:26,256 --> 02:28:29,376
- Mia! The chicken's dry.
- All right. I'm coming out already.

1917
02:28:34,723 --> 02:28:36,217
Here you go.

1918
02:28:38,143 --> 02:28:39,554
Hey, hold up.

1919
02:28:40,062 --> 02:28:45,305
Because you were the first to reach in
to get the chicken, you say grace.

1920
02:28:51,323 --> 02:28:54,028
- Dear heavenly....
- Spirit.

1921
02:28:55,703 --> 02:28:57,363
Spirit. Thank you.

1922
02:28:57,913 --> 02:29:03,121
Thank you for providing us
with a direct port nitrous injection...

1923
02:29:04,086 --> 02:29:07,918
...four core intercoolers
and ball-bearing turbos...

1924
02:29:08,090 --> 02:29:10,581
...and titanium valve springs.

1925
02:29:11,343 --> 02:29:12,968
- Thank you.
- Amen.

1926
02:29:14,096 --> 02:29:16,053
- Not bad.
- Amen.

1927
02:29:16,140 --> 02:29:18,382
He was praying to the car gods, man.

1928
02:29:19,727 --> 02:29:21,269
He's not the best.

1929
02:29:21,353 --> 02:29:23,512
- What do you want?
- Practice.

1930
02:29:23,606 --> 02:29:24,934
Thank you, girl.

1931
02:29:25,024 --> 02:29:28,607
Look who it is. "Old Coyotes 'R' Us."

1932
02:29:28,694 --> 02:29:31,446
I thought you weren't hungry, pumpkin.

1933
02:29:31,614 --> 02:29:34,568
- You know, I gotta eat.
- He's always hungry.

1934
02:29:34,659 --> 02:29:36,698
All right, sit down.

1935
02:29:44,085 --> 02:29:45,994
How you doing, Mia?

1936
02:29:49,173 --> 02:29:50,798
Here you go.

1937
02:29:57,265 --> 02:30:00,016
- Jesse, hand me that chicken.
- Let's eat some grub, man.

1938
02:30:00,101 --> 02:30:03,221
- Want some of that chicken?
- What, you rent a movie or something?

1939
02:30:10,320 --> 02:30:12,229
Need a hand with anything else?

1940
02:30:12,322 --> 02:30:15,773
No, I'm good. You can go join the boys
and watch the movie.

1941
02:30:16,284 --> 02:30:19,949
- The cook doesn't clean where I come from.
- I'd like to go there.

1942
02:30:25,126 --> 02:30:29,338
- I think we should go out sometime.
- No, I don't date my brother's friends.

1943
02:30:30,048 --> 02:30:31,542
That sucks.

1944
02:30:31,633 --> 02:30:34,966
- I'll have to kick his ass then.
- I'd love to see that one.

1945
02:30:35,053 --> 02:30:38,338
I would pay to see that one, actually.

1946
02:30:52,279 --> 02:30:53,987
Wash my car when you get done.

1947
02:30:54,072 --> 02:30:57,737
- What was that?
- No, Mia. I'm talking to the punk.

1948
02:30:58,577 --> 02:31:01,032
Wear your favorite dress,
'cause when you're done...

1949
02:31:01,121 --> 02:31:04,406
...I'm putting you on the street
where you belong, cutie.

1950
02:31:07,711 --> 02:31:11,411
Is this thing broken?
What's wrong with this thing?

1951
02:31:12,674 --> 02:31:16,672
What was that Cuban restaurant
you wanted to take me to?

1952
02:31:16,845 --> 02:31:18,838
The one with the picadillo and--

1953
02:31:18,930 --> 02:31:22,714
- With red candles, wooden tables--
- The plantain, food all over the place.

1954
02:31:22,809 --> 02:31:24,683
- What it's called?
- Cha Cha Cha.

1955
02:31:24,770 --> 02:31:26,727
- Yeah, that's it.
- Yeah.

1956
02:31:27,898 --> 02:31:29,890
Well, you can take me there.

1957
02:31:30,025 --> 02:31:32,646
Friday night at 10:00. Is that good for you?

1958
02:31:33,278 --> 02:31:35,318
- Yeah, it's perfect.
- Good.

1959
02:31:41,745 --> 02:31:45,659
- There's no popcorn.
- Make your own goddamn popcorn!

1960
02:31:59,680 --> 02:32:02,253
All right. Now that's valet parking.

1961
02:32:06,186 --> 02:32:08,475
- Harry. What's up, dog?
- Nice to see you.

1962
02:32:08,564 --> 02:32:10,391
Excellent. Come on in, man.

1963
02:32:10,482 --> 02:32:13,602
- Check it. It's yours.
- Damn. What do we got here?

1964
02:32:14,737 --> 02:32:17,228
- Hired some new help?
- Don't even think about it.

1965
02:32:17,323 --> 02:32:19,778
- What's up?
- What's up, Brian? How you feeling?

1966
02:32:19,867 --> 02:32:22,784
- Pretty good. What do you need?
- What's up, man?

1967
02:32:22,870 --> 02:32:26,405
I need you to hook me up.
Three of everything. I made a list.

1968
02:32:28,042 --> 02:32:29,999
Why don't you look that over?

1969
02:32:30,294 --> 02:32:33,461
- When do you need this stuff by?
- Tomorrow, today, now.

1970
02:32:33,881 --> 02:32:36,123
- Right.
- White boys work fast, don't they?

1971
02:32:39,387 --> 02:32:40,715
That's right.

1972
02:32:43,599 --> 02:32:47,099
- You said you need three of each?
- Yeah, three of everything.

1973
02:32:47,895 --> 02:32:50,565
What do you think about that?
Check this out.

1974
02:34:58,694 --> 02:35:00,236
He moans like a cop.

1975
02:35:09,538 --> 02:35:13,702
Brian, this is one of those times
you need to be clear about what you say.

1976
02:35:14,460 --> 02:35:16,452
Nod if you understand me.

1977
02:35:16,545 --> 02:35:17,826
Nod!

1978
02:35:19,673 --> 02:35:21,084
Sit up.

1979
02:35:27,348 --> 02:35:30,017
Tell me what the hell you're doing
down here.

1980
02:35:30,309 --> 02:35:32,765
Shit. What I'm doing?

1981
02:35:35,356 --> 02:35:36,731
Dom.

1982
02:35:38,984 --> 02:35:41,689
I owe you a 10-second car.

1983
02:35:42,655 --> 02:35:46,273
And what this is about,
this is about Race Wars.

1984
02:35:49,453 --> 02:35:53,321
I just went in there,
and Hector is gonna be running...

1985
02:35:53,791 --> 02:35:56,329
...three Honda Civics with Spoon engines.

1986
02:35:56,460 --> 02:35:59,296
And on top of that,
he just came into Harry's...

1987
02:35:59,380 --> 02:36:03,627
...and he ordered three T66 turbos,
with NOS...

1988
02:36:05,261 --> 02:36:07,337
...and a MoTeC system exhaust.

1989
02:36:10,850 --> 02:36:12,558
So, what are you saying?

1990
02:36:13,770 --> 02:36:18,313
You're gonna check everybody's shit out,
one garage after another?

1991
02:36:21,194 --> 02:36:22,652
Yeah.

1992
02:36:25,490 --> 02:36:29,404
Because, Dom, you know I can't lose again.

1993
02:36:31,412 --> 02:36:32,788
He's a cop.

1994
02:36:35,124 --> 02:36:36,239
He's a cop!

1995
02:36:39,546 --> 02:36:40,874
You a cop?

1996
02:36:47,387 --> 02:36:49,214
Let's go for a little ride.

1997
02:36:52,225 --> 02:36:53,600
Walk!

1998
02:37:12,996 --> 02:37:14,704
Okay. You stand watch.

1999
02:37:45,445 --> 02:37:47,105
Yo, Dominic.

2000
02:37:48,865 --> 02:37:50,525
There's no engines.

2001
02:37:51,660 --> 02:37:54,412
What are they planning on racing with,
hopes and dreams?

2002
02:37:54,496 --> 02:37:56,904
I don't know, but they're sneaky as shit...

2003
02:37:56,999 --> 02:37:59,834
...and they've got enough money
to buy anything.

2004
02:38:05,007 --> 02:38:05,956
What?

2005
02:38:15,100 --> 02:38:16,429
We got a wolf pack.

2006
02:38:16,935 --> 02:38:20,601
<i>It's Johnny Tran,
and he's coming your way really fast.</i>

2007
02:38:21,065 --> 02:38:23,686
All right, we got company. Spilner.

2008
02:38:49,677 --> 02:38:51,966
Come on. Move!

2009
02:38:52,221 --> 02:38:54,261
Let me ask you a question, Ted.

2010
02:38:55,766 --> 02:38:58,970
- Do you see anything wrong here?
- No.

2011
02:39:02,857 --> 02:39:05,264
- We got no engines, do we?
- No.

2012
02:39:05,359 --> 02:39:06,640
- Do we?
- No.

2013
02:39:09,739 --> 02:39:12,312
A couple of Nissan SR20 motors
will pull a premium...

2014
02:39:12,408 --> 02:39:15,444
- ...one week before Race Wars, huh?
- Yeah, probably.

2015
02:39:15,828 --> 02:39:18,829
You're a smart fence, Ted.
Maybe too smart.

2016
02:39:20,333 --> 02:39:22,242
What are you feeling, Lance?

2017
02:39:23,753 --> 02:39:25,295
40-weight?

2018
02:39:25,797 --> 02:39:27,623
50-weight?

2019
02:39:28,257 --> 02:39:29,965
A 40-weight sounds nice.

2020
02:39:45,567 --> 02:39:47,109
Where are they, Ted?

2021
02:39:47,277 --> 02:39:49,103
- Where are they?
- Enough!

2022
02:39:49,279 --> 02:39:51,770
- Where are they?
- They're in a warehouse.

2023
02:39:52,323 --> 02:39:54,233
They're in a warehouse, man!

2024
02:40:10,508 --> 02:40:11,789
Ted.

2025
02:40:11,885 --> 02:40:13,545
Kiss my shoes?

2026
02:40:25,815 --> 02:40:27,689
Let's go get our engines.

2027
02:40:28,568 --> 02:40:31,355
My superiors are flying in from D.C.,
in two days.

2028
02:40:31,446 --> 02:40:33,071
I want something to show.

2029
02:40:33,156 --> 02:40:35,647
We've got a fence
with a lube hose in his mouth...

2030
02:40:35,742 --> 02:40:39,360
...automatic weapons,
priors on every one of these Asian punks...

2031
02:40:39,454 --> 02:40:42,788
...a garage full of DVD players
and generally psychotic behavior.

2032
02:40:42,874 --> 02:40:46,243
Tell me why we shouldn't move
on Tran now and figure it out later?

2033
02:40:46,336 --> 02:40:48,080
Because all we have is behavior.

2034
02:40:48,171 --> 02:40:51,256
Let me get hard evidence,
because what we have now is just--

2035
02:40:51,341 --> 02:40:53,334
What we have is probable cause.

2036
02:40:53,427 --> 02:40:57,294
And truckers arming themselves for some
good old-fashioned vigilante mayhem.

2037
02:40:57,389 --> 02:41:01,469
- Tell us about Hector, Brian.
- Latinos with spear guns. Give me a break.

2038
02:41:01,727 --> 02:41:05,309
Hector's still working on the engines,
but the tires don't match.

2039
02:41:05,397 --> 02:41:07,188
Will somebody give me a cigarette?

2040
02:41:07,274 --> 02:41:09,397
- Get him a cigarette.
- Don't give him one.

2041
02:41:09,651 --> 02:41:12,107
- I thought you quit.
- I did. Just give me one.

2042
02:41:12,196 --> 02:41:13,939
- Get him a cigarette.
- No!

2043
02:41:16,241 --> 02:41:17,866
Tell me about Toretto.

2044
02:41:18,118 --> 02:41:20,905
I told you,
I think he's too controlled for this.

2045
02:41:20,996 --> 02:41:25,623
Going suicidal on semi-trucks? No way.
Maybe Vince. But he's too dumb to do it.

2046
02:41:26,001 --> 02:41:29,666
- I think the kid sister's blurring your vision.
- What did you say?

2047
02:41:29,755 --> 02:41:33,338
I don't blame you.
I'd get off on her surveillance photos, too.

2048
02:41:36,136 --> 02:41:37,381
Knock it off!

2049
02:41:38,555 --> 02:41:41,093
What? Are you going native on me, Brian?

2050
02:41:45,771 --> 02:41:48,013
Have you read Toretto's file lately?

2051
02:41:48,274 --> 02:41:50,599
- Yeah. I memorized that file.
- Read it again.

2052
02:41:50,693 --> 02:41:53,100
No, better still, take a look at these.

2053
02:41:54,905 --> 02:41:58,274
Remember I told you about the guy
he nearly beat to death?

2054
02:41:58,701 --> 02:42:01,986
Toretto did this
with a three-quarter-inch torque wrench.

2055
02:42:02,496 --> 02:42:04,453
He's a model of self-control.

2056
02:42:07,376 --> 02:42:09,084
I need a few more days.

2057
02:42:11,839 --> 02:42:13,037
I need a few more days.

2058
02:42:15,968 --> 02:42:17,546
Got a TR7 here,
with a ball-bearing upgrade.

2059
02:42:18,930 --> 02:42:22,797
What it's going to do is,
it's going to spool up really quick.

2060
02:42:22,975 --> 02:42:25,466
- I got this set up for 24 psi.
- Got it.

2061
02:42:28,981 --> 02:42:30,773
You got big plans tonight?

2062
02:42:32,902 --> 02:42:35,060
Yeah. We're going out to dinner.

2063
02:42:36,656 --> 02:42:39,229
You break her heart, I'll break your neck.

2064
02:42:39,867 --> 02:42:41,362
That's not gonna happen.

2065
02:42:46,541 --> 02:42:48,368
I want to show you something.

2066
02:43:02,640 --> 02:43:04,348
Me and my dad built her.

2067
02:43:05,226 --> 02:43:07,598
Nine hundred horses of Detroit muscle.

2068
02:43:08,897 --> 02:43:10,142
It's a beast.

2069
02:43:10,732 --> 02:43:13,602
- You know what she ran in Palmdale?
- No. What?

2070
02:43:13,777 --> 02:43:15,235
Nine seconds flat.

2071
02:43:16,738 --> 02:43:18,861
- God.
- My dad was driving.

2072
02:43:19,407 --> 02:43:23,619
So much torque,
the chassis twisted coming off the line.

2073
02:43:24,704 --> 02:43:26,661
Barely kept her on the track.

2074
02:43:27,415 --> 02:43:30,333
- So, what's your best time?
- I've never driven her.

2075
02:43:30,418 --> 02:43:31,498
Why not?

2076
02:43:34,256 --> 02:43:36,213
It scares the shit out of me.

2077
02:43:38,635 --> 02:43:39,880
That's my dad.

2078
02:43:41,388 --> 02:43:44,093
He was coming up
in the pro stock-car circuit.

2079
02:43:44,516 --> 02:43:46,224
Last race of the season.

2080
02:43:47,352 --> 02:43:51,564
A guy named Kenny Linder
came up from inside, in the final turn.

2081
02:43:52,399 --> 02:43:55,898
He clipped his bumper
and put him into the wall at 120.

2082
02:43:59,072 --> 02:44:01,444
I watched my dad burn to death.

2083
02:44:03,994 --> 02:44:06,070
I remembered hearing him scream.

2084
02:44:09,249 --> 02:44:13,792
But the people that were there
said he had died before the tanks blew.

2085
02:44:20,177 --> 02:44:22,549
They said it was me who was screaming.

2086
02:44:26,099 --> 02:44:28,507
I saw Linder about a week later.

2087
02:44:29,895 --> 02:44:33,311
I had a wrench, and I hit him.

2088
02:44:33,649 --> 02:44:38,358
And I didn't intend to keep hitting him,
but when I finished, I couldn't lift my arm.

2089
02:44:43,742 --> 02:44:46,031
He's a janitor at a high school.

2090
02:44:47,162 --> 02:44:49,700
He has to take the bus to work every day.

2091
02:44:50,916 --> 02:44:53,621
And they banned me
from the tracks for life.

2092
02:44:59,258 --> 02:45:01,749
I live my life a quarter-mile at a time.

2093
02:45:03,596 --> 02:45:06,383
Nothing else matters.
Not the mortgage, not the store...

2094
02:45:06,474 --> 02:45:08,965
...not my team and all their bullshit.

2095
02:45:10,686 --> 02:45:13,058
For those 10 seconds or less...

2096
02:45:14,565 --> 02:45:16,225
...I'm free.

2097
02:45:36,712 --> 02:45:39,963
So, how is it, anyways,
that the gang came to be?

2098
02:45:40,216 --> 02:45:41,331
- What?
- The gang.

2099
02:45:41,425 --> 02:45:43,833
The gang?
No, they don't call themselves a gang.

2100
02:45:43,928 --> 02:45:46,253
- What do they call themselves?
- They're a team.

2101
02:45:46,347 --> 02:45:50,345
- They call themselves a team.
- All right. How did the team come to be?

2102
02:45:50,810 --> 02:45:53,099
Well, that's a whole lot of history.

2103
02:45:54,522 --> 02:45:58,223
- I've got time.
- Okay. Vince grew up with my brother.

2104
02:45:59,193 --> 02:46:02,313
Actually, he didn't ever actually grow up,
as you can tell.

2105
02:46:02,405 --> 02:46:04,398
But they were friends as kids.

2106
02:46:04,616 --> 02:46:07,189
And Letty, she just lived down the street.

2107
02:46:07,368 --> 02:46:10,618
Always into cars, though.
Ever since she was, like, 10 years old.

2108
02:46:10,705 --> 02:46:14,288
So, naturally, you know,
my brother always had her attention.

2109
02:46:14,959 --> 02:46:18,624
- And then she turned 16--
- And then she had Dom's attention.

2110
02:46:18,922 --> 02:46:21,839
Yeah. It's funny how that works, isn't it?

2111
02:46:22,592 --> 02:46:23,837
Yeah.

2112
02:46:27,138 --> 02:46:29,629
How does Jesse fit into the whole thing?

2113
02:46:29,766 --> 02:46:34,724
Jesse. Well, Jesse and Leon just sort of
showed up one night and never, ever left.

2114
02:46:35,563 --> 02:46:38,849
It's just the way my brother is, you know.
Dom's like....

2115
02:46:40,402 --> 02:46:42,359
He's like gravity.

2116
02:46:43,488 --> 02:46:45,694
Everything just gets pulled to him.

2117
02:46:47,325 --> 02:46:48,701
Even you.

2118
02:46:50,912 --> 02:46:52,288
No.

2119
02:46:52,414 --> 02:46:53,789
No.

2120
02:46:54,249 --> 02:46:57,084
The only thing that pulled me in was you.

2121
02:46:57,169 --> 02:47:00,004
Being friends with your brother
is just a bonus.

2122
02:47:02,758 --> 02:47:04,300
That's good.

2123
02:47:06,136 --> 02:47:09,671
That's good. It's nice to come first
every once in a while.

2124
02:47:13,310 --> 02:47:14,341
Want to go for a drive?

2125
02:47:53,058 --> 02:47:55,300
- Yeah?
<i>- The hijackers have hit again.</i>

2126
02:47:55,394 --> 02:48:00,471
<i>Bilkins has decided that we're gonna move
on Johnny Tran and his guys at 17:00.</i>

2127
02:48:00,566 --> 02:48:02,440
<i>Unless you say otherwise.</i>

2128
02:48:02,526 --> 02:48:04,400
<i>If you agree, just say yes.</i>

2129
02:48:05,029 --> 02:48:07,021
- Yeah.
- Who is that?

2130
02:48:09,283 --> 02:48:11,026
It's just a wrong number.

2131
02:51:03,250 --> 02:51:05,409
Yes, sir. Yeah, I know, but--

2132
02:51:05,628 --> 02:51:08,297
Yeah. Yes, sir.

2133
02:51:08,505 --> 02:51:09,916
Yeah. I got it.

2134
02:51:14,303 --> 02:51:16,342
The DVD players were purchased legally.

2135
02:51:16,430 --> 02:51:19,680
All we've got are a couple
of low-rent weapons charges...

2136
02:51:19,767 --> 02:51:22,056
...and some outstanding speeding tickets.

2137
02:51:22,144 --> 02:51:23,804
- So, they're out.
- Yeah.

2138
02:51:24,021 --> 02:51:25,599
Father bailed them out.

2139
02:51:26,732 --> 02:51:30,481
Is this the kind of intelligence
I can expect from you, O'Conner?

2140
02:51:35,324 --> 02:51:38,491
- You're gonna put this on me?
- I can put it on whoever I want to.

2141
02:51:38,577 --> 02:51:41,282
- Perks of the job.
- No, you can't put this on me--

2142
02:51:41,372 --> 02:51:43,246
No, wait a minute. Let me tell you.

2143
02:51:43,332 --> 02:51:47,544
I don't care if you have to aim at someone
and blow your cover to smithereens.

2144
02:51:47,628 --> 02:51:50,166
You've got 36 hours to crack this bastard...

2145
02:51:50,256 --> 02:51:53,340
...or you might want to think
about another career.

2146
02:52:04,395 --> 02:52:07,811
It's Toretto, Brian.
It always has been Toretto.

2147
02:52:09,192 --> 02:52:11,065
Tran and Hector are....

2148
02:52:11,486 --> 02:52:13,277
They're just fumes.

2149
02:52:16,532 --> 02:52:19,237
I know you've been lying to me.
My question is this:

2150
02:52:19,327 --> 02:52:22,992
Have you been lying to yourself
because you can't see past Mia?

2151
02:52:25,625 --> 02:52:27,618
He won't go back to prison.

2152
02:52:28,586 --> 02:52:31,457
Well, that's a choice
he's going to have to make.

2153
02:52:35,552 --> 02:52:37,959
There's all kinds of family, Brian.

2154
02:52:39,389 --> 02:52:42,176
And that's a choice
you're gonna have to make.

2155
02:53:00,201 --> 02:53:02,194
You ready for this?

2156
02:53:28,605 --> 02:53:31,440
Nice car.
What's the retail on one of those?

2157
02:53:32,067 --> 02:53:34,640
More than you can afford, pal. Ferrari.

2158
02:53:40,826 --> 02:53:42,320
Smoke him.

2159
02:54:37,258 --> 02:54:39,049
So, what's wrong, Brian?

2160
02:54:40,010 --> 02:54:41,718
Nothing, man, I'm fine.

2161
02:54:42,179 --> 02:54:45,429
Come on. Obviously something's off.

2162
02:54:45,975 --> 02:54:49,675
Look, I have my good days and bad days
just like anybody else.

2163
02:54:50,354 --> 02:54:53,937
Brian, don't lose that cool of yours.
That's your meal ticket.

2164
02:54:55,901 --> 02:54:58,737
My meal ticket?
I can't pay for my own shrimp?

2165
02:54:58,904 --> 02:55:00,363
I got the shrimp.

2166
02:55:00,781 --> 02:55:03,355
No, that's one thing about me
you don't understand.

2167
02:55:03,451 --> 02:55:07,116
I don't take handouts.
I earn my way, every step.

2168
02:55:08,039 --> 02:55:10,411
I need something extra on the side,
like you.

2169
02:55:10,500 --> 02:55:12,457
What do you mean, like me?

2170
02:55:12,752 --> 02:55:15,622
- What's that supposed to mean?
- That's what I mean.

2171
02:55:15,713 --> 02:55:18,418
- What does that mean, like me?
- Don't try--

2172
02:55:18,716 --> 02:55:20,625
I'm not stupid, all right?

2173
02:55:21,010 --> 02:55:25,090
I know that there's no way you paid
for all that shit you got under the hood--

2174
02:55:25,181 --> 02:55:28,550
There's no way you paid for
what's under the hood of those cars...

2175
02:55:28,643 --> 02:55:31,395
...by doing tune-ups and selling groceries.

2176
02:55:32,230 --> 02:55:35,231
Whatever it is you're in on,
I want in on it, too.

2177
02:55:58,089 --> 02:56:00,165
- Well, what is this?
- Read it.

2178
02:56:00,967 --> 02:56:03,256
- What is this for?
- It's directions.

2179
02:56:05,263 --> 02:56:06,971
To Race Wars.

2180
02:56:07,474 --> 02:56:09,265
We'll see how you go.

2181
02:56:10,268 --> 02:56:11,893
Then we'll talk.

2182
02:56:58,191 --> 02:56:59,816
- How's it going?
- What's up?

2183
02:56:59,902 --> 02:57:02,571
- Welcome to Race Wars.
- Great. Thanks a lot.

2184
02:57:25,970 --> 02:57:27,677
Baby. Hey, baby.

2185
02:57:28,847 --> 02:57:30,674
You should watch from the side.

2186
02:57:30,766 --> 02:57:33,222
I wouldn't want to get exhaust
on that pretty face.

2187
02:57:33,310 --> 02:57:37,390
- Put your money where your mouth is.
- I'll race you for that sweet little ass.

2188
02:57:37,481 --> 02:57:39,937
You want ass,
why don't you hit Hollywood Boulevard?

2189
02:57:40,025 --> 02:57:43,110
You want an adrenaline rush,
it'll be two large.

2190
02:57:43,195 --> 02:57:46,196
Right here. Right now.
What's it gonna be?

2191
02:57:48,868 --> 02:57:50,278
You got it.

2192
02:58:10,306 --> 02:58:12,345
"Another one bites the dust"

2193
02:58:15,645 --> 02:58:17,554
Come on. What you got?

2194
02:58:18,272 --> 02:58:19,731
See ya.

2195
02:58:55,727 --> 02:58:58,681
- What's up?
- Hey, what's up, Jesse?

2196
02:58:59,147 --> 02:59:00,427
What's in your hand?

2197
02:59:00,523 --> 02:59:02,895
Throwing down the pink slip, just like you.

2198
02:59:02,984 --> 02:59:05,605
- The pink slip to what? The Jetta?
- Yeah.

2199
02:59:06,029 --> 02:59:08,567
- You can't bet your dad's car.
- It's all right.

2200
02:59:08,656 --> 02:59:09,937
I ain't losing.

2201
02:59:10,033 --> 02:59:13,532
This fool is running a Honda 2000.
I'll win.

2202
02:59:13,703 --> 02:59:18,246
That way, me and my dad can roll
when he gets out of prison. It's all good.

2203
02:59:18,333 --> 02:59:21,951
They're gonna throw him right back
in prison after he kills you.

2204
02:59:29,594 --> 02:59:31,551
You visualize the win.

2205
02:59:31,638 --> 02:59:35,303
Visualize the win, Jesse. I'm serious.
You got to listen to me, man.

2206
02:59:35,392 --> 02:59:36,934
Who are you racing?

2207
02:59:41,314 --> 02:59:43,521
Jesse, don't do it.

2208
02:59:43,650 --> 02:59:47,315
I bet you he's got more than $100,000
under the hood of that car.

2209
03:00:10,469 --> 03:00:12,046
Too soon, junior.

2210
03:00:15,682 --> 03:00:16,548
No!

2211
03:00:19,686 --> 03:00:20,885
Shit!

2212
03:00:21,522 --> 03:00:22,684
Oh, God!

2213
03:00:33,117 --> 03:00:35,786
Yo! Heads up, bro. We got problems.

2214
03:00:35,869 --> 03:00:37,613
- What?
- Jesse.

2215
03:00:39,123 --> 03:00:41,162
Where's Jesse going?

2216
03:00:41,333 --> 03:00:44,833
- He just raced Tran for slips.
- Oh, shit.

2217
03:00:56,515 --> 03:00:59,635
- Where's he going?
- He went to the car wash.

2218
03:00:59,852 --> 03:01:01,809
Whatever. Go fetch my car.

2219
03:01:02,396 --> 03:01:04,021
Go fetch your car?

2220
03:01:04,982 --> 03:01:06,642
We're not on your block.

2221
03:01:06,734 --> 03:01:09,355
You better watch who you talk to like that.

2222
03:01:09,904 --> 03:01:11,018
Toretto!

2223
03:01:14,325 --> 03:01:16,199
SWAT came into my house...

2224
03:01:17,161 --> 03:01:21,408
...disrespected my whole family,
because somebody narced me out.

2225
03:01:22,124 --> 03:01:24,580
And you know what? It was you!

2226
03:01:48,943 --> 03:01:50,983
Get off of him, man.

2227
03:02:00,330 --> 03:02:02,121
Dom, chill out, man. Come on!

2228
03:02:02,207 --> 03:02:03,998
I never narced on nobody!

2229
03:02:04,125 --> 03:02:06,616
I never narced on nobody!

2230
03:02:45,625 --> 03:02:46,705
Mia.

2231
03:02:51,465 --> 03:02:53,837
I have respected you
and I haven't said shit.

2232
03:02:53,925 --> 03:02:55,669
Now I am asking you not to go.

2233
03:02:55,761 --> 03:02:58,631
- I'm doing this for both of us.
- Don't give me that crap.

2234
03:02:58,722 --> 03:03:00,181
You're doing this for you.

2235
03:03:00,265 --> 03:03:04,393
Why are you insisting on doing this?
Dom, please, just don't.

2236
03:03:16,365 --> 03:03:18,856
- Mia, what's going on?
- What?

2237
03:03:18,951 --> 03:03:21,442
- You know what I'm talking about.
- No, I don't.

2238
03:03:21,537 --> 03:03:24,787
You always have tears in your eyes
when Dom drives away?

2239
03:03:24,915 --> 03:03:26,457
What's the matter with you?

2240
03:03:26,542 --> 03:03:29,115
What's he racing off
in the middle of the night for?

2241
03:03:29,211 --> 03:03:32,378
- You know about the trucks?
- No, Brian! What trucks?

2242
03:03:32,464 --> 03:03:36,332
- Jesus Christ. What?
- Listen to me.

2243
03:03:37,594 --> 03:03:39,053
Mia, I'm a cop.

2244
03:03:40,597 --> 03:03:43,267
What are you talking about, Brian?
What is this?

2245
03:03:43,350 --> 03:03:46,802
Ever since the first time I met you,
I've been undercover.

2246
03:03:48,063 --> 03:03:49,261
I'm a cop.

2247
03:03:54,320 --> 03:03:55,944
Oh, you bastard.

2248
03:03:58,782 --> 03:04:00,063
You bastard.

2249
03:04:02,453 --> 03:04:04,280
- Mia.
- Get off of me, Brian!

2250
03:04:04,371 --> 03:04:06,115
Mia! Listen to me!

2251
03:04:07,374 --> 03:04:09,948
Everything I ever said
I felt about you was real.

2252
03:04:10,044 --> 03:04:12,665
I swear to God.
You have to believe me, Mia.

2253
03:04:12,755 --> 03:04:16,373
But this isn't about you and me.
Your brother's out there to pull a job.

2254
03:04:16,467 --> 03:04:19,918
We're running out of time. Those truckers
aren't laying down anymore.

2255
03:04:20,012 --> 03:04:23,761
Maybe they'll make it through tonight,
but every law enforcement agency...

2256
03:04:23,849 --> 03:04:25,557
...is coming down on them.

2257
03:04:25,643 --> 03:04:28,560
If you don't want anything to happen
to them...

2258
03:04:28,646 --> 03:04:31,730
...you have to get in that car
with me right now and help me.

2259
03:04:33,276 --> 03:04:36,609
Mia, you are the only person
that can help me right now.

2260
03:04:37,405 --> 03:04:40,738
Please, Mia. Please help me.

2261
03:04:52,670 --> 03:04:55,505
Civics are stashed somewhere
outside of Thermal.

2262
03:04:55,590 --> 03:04:58,875
They wouldn't double back,
and Highway 10 is too well patrolled.

2263
03:04:58,968 --> 03:05:01,922
- So, what does that leave us with?
- All this.

2264
03:05:10,855 --> 03:05:13,726
<i>- Nextel.</i>
- This is Officer Brian O'Conner.

2265
03:05:13,900 --> 03:05:18,277
Serial number 34762.
I need a cell phone trace.

2266
03:05:18,488 --> 03:05:21,524
<i>- Okay. What's the cell number?</i>
- Mia, what is it?

2267
03:05:23,660 --> 03:05:26,826
Come on, Mia.
She needs Dom's cell phone number now.

2268
03:05:30,166 --> 03:05:34,875
323-555-6439.

2269
03:05:35,964 --> 03:05:38,537
Thank you. Yeah, you get that?

2270
03:06:04,743 --> 03:06:08,575
All right, we're one man short.
Letty, I need you on the left side.

2271
03:06:10,874 --> 03:06:14,208
Your sister's right about this one.
This don't feel good.

2272
03:06:14,336 --> 03:06:18,464
- Don't do that.
- Something's wrong.

2273
03:06:18,548 --> 03:06:21,384
- Stop.
- We shouldn't be doing this without Jesse.

2274
03:06:22,511 --> 03:06:25,465
This is the mother Iode.
We've been on this for three months.

2275
03:06:25,555 --> 03:06:28,047
After this, it's a long vacation for everyone.

2276
03:06:28,141 --> 03:06:30,099
- Let's go.
- I hope so.

2277
03:06:33,647 --> 03:06:36,731
Listen, the other night I had a dream...

2278
03:06:37,234 --> 03:06:39,939
...that you and I were
on the beach in Mexico.

2279
03:06:40,320 --> 03:06:42,360
- Really?
- Really.

2280
03:06:45,534 --> 03:06:47,692
Come on. Let's make this happen.

2281
03:06:50,789 --> 03:06:55,285
- Leon, keep on those scanners.
- Copy that.

2282
03:06:58,839 --> 03:07:00,879
All right, let's go.

2283
03:07:11,477 --> 03:07:14,561
<i>Okay, we traced the number
to the northbound 86.</i>

2284
03:07:14,647 --> 03:07:19,143
<i>Mile 114, outside Coachella.
We'll keep the trace open, Officer.</i>

2285
03:07:19,485 --> 03:07:20,896
Let me see this.

2286
03:07:25,699 --> 03:07:27,941
I think we're about 40 miles away.

2287
03:07:28,369 --> 03:07:29,993
What are you gonna do?

2288
03:07:31,288 --> 03:07:33,281
What are you gonna do?

2289
03:08:05,573 --> 03:08:07,649
Okay! Go time!

2290
03:08:23,341 --> 03:08:25,797
We're all good.
I got nothing on the scanners.

2291
03:08:25,885 --> 03:08:27,166
Keep going.

2292
03:08:41,735 --> 03:08:42,897
Vince!

2293
03:08:43,570 --> 03:08:45,646
Vince, don't! Get back in!

2294
03:08:47,240 --> 03:08:48,355
Vince!

2295
03:08:53,997 --> 03:08:55,705
He's got a damn shotgun! Leon!

2296
03:08:55,790 --> 03:08:58,079
Back off! Get him off of there!

2297
03:09:00,754 --> 03:09:02,034
Oh, shit!

2298
03:09:13,099 --> 03:09:15,769
Get me off this thing! Pull up!

2299
03:09:16,895 --> 03:09:20,229
Unhook yourself. Do it!

2300
03:09:20,607 --> 03:09:22,600
- Do it!
- I can't get--

2301
03:09:22,693 --> 03:09:24,068
You can do it!

2302
03:09:25,112 --> 03:09:26,570
Come on, Vince!

2303
03:09:34,079 --> 03:09:36,652
Dom! I'm pulling up to distract him!

2304
03:09:44,131 --> 03:09:45,590
Come on, boy!

2305
03:09:46,800 --> 03:09:48,923
Shot doesn't get better than this.

2306
03:09:53,974 --> 03:09:55,255
Son of a bitch!

2307
03:10:00,105 --> 03:10:02,431
Take me off here,
or I'll have to unhook the wire!

2308
03:10:02,524 --> 03:10:06,771
Try it again. One, two, three!

2309
03:10:18,791 --> 03:10:20,368
Unhook yourself!

2310
03:10:22,127 --> 03:10:24,001
I can't get my arm free!

2311
03:10:24,088 --> 03:10:26,330
- Vince, grab my hand!
- My arm!

2312
03:10:26,423 --> 03:10:28,215
Listen, give me your hand.

2313
03:10:28,384 --> 03:10:30,839
I'm gonna pull you off the rig!

2314
03:10:34,014 --> 03:10:35,639
Vince!

2315
03:10:35,725 --> 03:10:37,717
Hold on!

2316
03:10:37,810 --> 03:10:39,933
Give me your hand! Listen to me!

2317
03:10:46,777 --> 03:10:47,773
Dominic!

2318
03:10:47,862 --> 03:10:49,060
Shit!

2319
03:10:52,617 --> 03:10:54,740
- Dominic!
- Hang on!

2320
03:10:55,328 --> 03:10:58,245
Dom! Move out of the way.
I'm coming to get him.

2321
03:11:23,356 --> 03:11:24,684
Letty!

2322
03:11:25,483 --> 03:11:26,514
Leon!

2323
03:11:26,609 --> 03:11:27,688
Pull back for Letty.

2324
03:11:27,777 --> 03:11:29,057
<i>Get her out of there!</i>

2325
03:11:29,153 --> 03:11:30,564
I'm on it! Go!

2326
03:11:39,747 --> 03:11:42,417
I've got her! You get Vince off that truck.

2327
03:11:47,756 --> 03:11:49,997
Letty! Come on, baby.

2328
03:11:51,050 --> 03:11:52,130
You okay?

2329
03:11:52,218 --> 03:11:54,626
Oh, shit. Come on, girl, you all right?

2330
03:11:54,721 --> 03:11:58,304
Come on, let me look at you.
Come on. We got to go. Let's go.

2331
03:12:12,113 --> 03:12:13,608
Vince!

2332
03:12:41,893 --> 03:12:43,056
Take the wheel.

2333
03:12:43,145 --> 03:12:45,850
- What do you mean?
- Put your foot on the gas!

2334
03:12:46,607 --> 03:12:48,895
I'm gonna get him.
Put your foot on the gas!

2335
03:12:48,984 --> 03:12:50,229
Okay!

2336
03:12:53,614 --> 03:12:56,698
- Come on. Keep it steady.
- I got it!

2337
03:12:58,243 --> 03:13:00,200
All right, hold on, Vince.

2338
03:13:00,996 --> 03:13:03,914
He's having a hard time holding on.
Get me a little closer.

2339
03:13:03,999 --> 03:13:05,280
All right.

2340
03:13:06,126 --> 03:13:08,285
- Closer.
- I'm moving in.

2341
03:13:08,670 --> 03:13:10,248
Hold it right there!

2342
03:13:11,090 --> 03:13:12,169
Go!

2343
03:13:14,343 --> 03:13:16,916
You got to hang in here with me now!

2344
03:13:17,012 --> 03:13:19,171
We'll get you off. Give me your arm!

2345
03:13:19,264 --> 03:13:21,423
Vince, look at me! Don't let go!

2346
03:13:25,396 --> 03:13:27,969
Come on, Vince!
Throw this arm around me!

2347
03:13:28,774 --> 03:13:31,099
Vince, don't let go!

2348
03:13:35,322 --> 03:13:37,398
Come on, Mia. Get closer!

2349
03:13:42,955 --> 03:13:44,663
Mia, get closer! Come on.

2350
03:13:44,749 --> 03:13:46,622
Come on, Vince. Here we go!

2351
03:14:14,695 --> 03:14:15,976
Shit.

2352
03:14:19,617 --> 03:14:23,152
It's gonna be okay, Letty. I love you.

2353
03:14:26,416 --> 03:14:28,040
- Watch her.
- I got her.

2354
03:14:28,960 --> 03:14:31,498
Come on, Vince! Hang in there! Come on!

2355
03:14:35,675 --> 03:14:38,842
If he doesn't get to an ambulance
in 10 minutes, he's dead.

2356
03:14:38,928 --> 03:14:41,384
- Hold the pressure. Hold his arm up.
- I got it.

2357
03:14:47,312 --> 03:14:50,266
Yeah. Yeah, this is Officer Brian O'Conner.

2358
03:14:50,481 --> 03:14:52,937
I'm off-duty MAPD.

2359
03:14:53,067 --> 03:14:55,855
I need a life flight roll out right away.

2360
03:14:56,988 --> 03:15:01,282
My 20 is Highway 86, mile marker 147.

2361
03:15:01,826 --> 03:15:04,863
I got one trauma victim,
about 24 years of age.

2362
03:15:04,954 --> 03:15:07,528
Six-foot, maybe 200 pounds.

2363
03:15:07,707 --> 03:15:11,456
He's got a deep laceration to his right arm
with arterial bleeding.

2364
03:15:11,544 --> 03:15:15,922
And he's got a shotgun wound
close range to his left flank.

2365
03:15:17,842 --> 03:15:19,752
Yeah, he's going into shock!

2366
03:16:59,820 --> 03:17:01,730
Dom, put the gun down now!

2367
03:17:04,325 --> 03:17:06,152
- Move your car.
- No bullshit!

2368
03:17:06,243 --> 03:17:08,699
Put it down now! No more running!

2369
03:17:08,829 --> 03:17:10,372
I'm not running!

2370
03:17:13,501 --> 03:17:15,908
- Where's Leon and Letty?
- They're long gone!

2371
03:17:16,003 --> 03:17:19,040
Then it's over.
I didn't call the police, but don't push me!

2372
03:17:19,131 --> 03:17:22,049
- Put the gun down. I swear to God!
- You are the cop!

2373
03:17:22,134 --> 03:17:23,545
You're a cop!

2374
03:17:25,138 --> 03:17:28,507
Brian, I got to find Jesse before they do.

2375
03:17:28,599 --> 03:17:31,470
- I'm all the kid's got.
- I'll call in the plates.

2376
03:17:31,561 --> 03:17:35,261
PD will pick him up way before
Johnny even gets near him.

2377
03:17:35,440 --> 03:17:38,891
- Move your car.
- Dom, stop it! It's over. Please.

2378
03:17:39,027 --> 03:17:40,734
Mia, stay out of it!

2379
03:17:46,284 --> 03:17:49,487
Dominic, I am so sorry.

2380
03:17:49,871 --> 03:17:52,077
I don't know what I'm doing, Dom.

2381
03:17:52,165 --> 03:17:56,412
I'm so scared right now.
I don't know what's going on.

2382
03:17:56,502 --> 03:17:59,254
What were you thinking, man?

2383
03:17:59,339 --> 03:18:01,830
I don't know! I panicked! I'm sorry.

2384
03:18:01,925 --> 03:18:03,834
I'm scared!

2385
03:18:03,927 --> 03:18:07,011
I don't know what I'm doing!
Will you please help me?

2386
03:18:11,559 --> 03:18:13,054
Dom!

2387
03:18:31,913 --> 03:18:33,242
Jesse!

2388
03:18:33,331 --> 03:18:34,826
No, Jesse!

2389
03:18:49,556 --> 03:18:51,181
No, Dom, no!

2390
03:21:46,067 --> 03:21:49,436
Call 911. You call 911!

2391
03:22:24,273 --> 03:22:27,024
I used to drag here back in high school.

2392
03:22:27,734 --> 03:22:31,898
That railroad crossing up there
is exactly a quarter mile away from here.

2393
03:22:33,073 --> 03:22:35,695
On green, I'm going for it.

2394
03:25:10,273 --> 03:25:12,515
That's not what I had in mind.

2395
03:25:59,073 --> 03:26:00,982
You know what you're doing?

2396
03:26:01,450 --> 03:26:03,526
I owe you a 10-second car.

2397
03:27:12,100 --> 03:27:14,400
<i>I live my life a quarter-mile at a time.</i>

2398
03:27:16,100 --> 03:27:18,100
<i>Nothing else matters.</i>

2399
03:27:19,100 --> 03:27:21,100
<i>For those 10 seconds or less...</i>

2400
03:27:23,100 --> 03:27:24,000
<i>...I'm free.</i>

2401
03:28:17,800 --> 03:28:20,594
Yo, Jimmy, man. Give me the status.
Tell me we good.

2402
03:28:20,678 --> 03:28:22,430
- You got it, man.
- Beautiful.

2403
03:28:22,888 --> 03:28:25,641
It's gonna be an all-timer tonight.

2404
03:28:29,812 --> 03:28:32,732
All right, fire them up!

2405
03:28:33,274 --> 03:28:35,067
We go live in five!

2406
03:28:36,068 --> 03:28:39,280
It's time for ignition
and straight automobile pimping.

2407
03:29:10,978 --> 03:29:12,855
- Girl!
- Sorry! My bad!

2408
03:29:17,776 --> 03:29:20,321
All right, ladies! We're good.

2409
03:29:21,113 --> 03:29:22,448
We're good.

2410
03:29:23,449 --> 03:29:24,742
That's it, babies.

2411
03:29:27,912 --> 03:29:30,372
Come on, Tej!
Let's get this race going!

2412
03:29:31,457 --> 03:29:33,167
Wait a second, man.

2413
03:29:33,250 --> 03:29:36,003
You cats are first wave.
Where's your fourth at?

2414
03:29:36,086 --> 03:29:39,215
It was Joaquin, but he had
to work the graveyard shift.

2415
03:29:39,298 --> 03:29:41,675
What? Graveyard shift, man.

2416
03:29:42,509 --> 03:29:46,430
- Why don't you run with us, Tej?
- Hell, I'm not running with y'all.

2417
03:29:46,764 --> 03:29:50,601
I tell you, either you find a fourth
or you don't race. How about that?

2418
03:29:50,684 --> 03:29:54,188
We should find two, so we don't have
to roll with skirt here.

2419
03:29:59,693 --> 03:30:01,528
Whoa, wait a second.

2420
03:30:01,904 --> 03:30:05,658
Why don't I find you a fourth
and we settle this on the streets?

2421
03:30:05,741 --> 03:30:08,077
- Bring him on.
- Anybody I want?

2422
03:30:08,452 --> 03:30:10,454
No matter who it is?

2423
03:30:10,537 --> 03:30:11,705
Yeah.

2424
03:30:17,253 --> 03:30:18,337
Yeah?

2425
03:30:18,420 --> 03:30:20,339
Yeah, man. You want to race tonight?

2426
03:30:20,422 --> 03:30:23,342
I could use the money.
You got four minutes.

2427
03:30:24,051 --> 03:30:25,386
I'll be there.

2428
03:30:53,288 --> 03:30:55,249
The race starts in four minutes.

2429
03:30:57,084 --> 03:30:59,169
All right, girls, let's do this.

2430
03:31:10,305 --> 03:31:13,142
- You think you'll win, baby?
- What do you think?

2431
03:31:14,018 --> 03:31:16,729
- You better. We got rent to pay.
- I know this.

2432
03:31:42,379 --> 03:31:45,090
I'll get you when you
get a car worth racing.

2433
03:31:54,266 --> 03:31:55,642
There's our fourth.

2434
03:31:55,726 --> 03:31:57,436
Shit. It's Brian.

2435
03:32:26,590 --> 03:32:28,967
- What's up, Tej?
- What's happening, dude?

2436
03:32:29,051 --> 03:32:32,095
- Thanks for the invite.
- No problem at all, man.

2437
03:32:32,179 --> 03:32:34,681
Just remember me
when you wax, all right?

2438
03:32:36,058 --> 03:32:37,684
They got deep pockets?

2439
03:32:38,894 --> 03:32:40,020
Real deep.

2440
03:32:42,564 --> 03:32:44,942
- What's up, Suki?
- What's up, Bullitt?

2441
03:32:45,025 --> 03:32:46,777
What do you say we kick it a nickel?

2442
03:32:48,320 --> 03:32:50,447
Nobody mentioned raising stakes.

2443
03:32:56,328 --> 03:32:58,580
If that's the case,
ask these nice people...

2444
03:32:58,664 --> 03:33:01,083
to back off the line
so you can go home.

2445
03:33:12,094 --> 03:33:14,638
Okay. $3,500.

2446
03:33:24,773 --> 03:33:26,024
$3,500?

2447
03:33:27,109 --> 03:33:29,361
Either that
or you can go home, bruh.

2448
03:33:34,574 --> 03:33:36,743
It's all there.
Better be.

2449
03:33:37,911 --> 03:33:41,498
Damn, Suki, when are you
going to pop my clutch?

2450
03:33:41,581 --> 03:33:43,750
As soon as you get
the right set of tools.

2451
03:33:43,834 --> 03:33:45,085
All right.

2452
03:34:05,313 --> 03:34:07,566
All right, back up. Let's go.

2453
03:34:09,609 --> 03:34:11,111
Back y'all asses up!

2454
03:34:11,194 --> 03:34:13,697
Back up before
you turn into barbecue around here.

2455
03:34:13,947 --> 03:34:16,158
It's not a game. This is serious.

2456
03:34:16,241 --> 03:34:19,494
All right, back up.
Get off the street. Let's go.

2457
03:34:19,661 --> 03:34:23,582
Back it up. Everybody keep
your heads real clear, all right?

2458
03:34:23,665 --> 03:34:25,917
'Cause I got a surprise
for y'all this evening.

2459
03:34:28,879 --> 03:34:30,839
Go, Slap Jack! Go, baby!

2460
03:34:30,922 --> 03:34:32,424
I got this.

2461
03:34:41,975 --> 03:34:43,852
Ready?

2462
03:34:47,647 --> 03:34:48,815
Go!

2463
03:35:39,908 --> 03:35:41,284
Oh, hell, no!

2464
03:35:56,299 --> 03:35:58,927
You ain't passing me, dawg. Come on.

2465
03:36:01,596 --> 03:36:02,847
What you got?

2466
03:36:09,145 --> 03:36:11,147
I told you, you wouldn't pass me!

2467
03:36:24,035 --> 03:36:25,287
Move, bitch!

2468
03:37:14,377 --> 03:37:15,795
Not tonight, baby!

2469
03:37:15,879 --> 03:37:17,797
Bend over, boy.

2470
03:37:21,468 --> 03:37:22,719
Damn, girl!

2471
03:37:33,980 --> 03:37:35,273
Last turn.

2472
03:37:37,984 --> 03:37:39,069
Too wide.

2473
03:37:50,580 --> 03:37:52,082
Home stretch, baby.

2474
03:38:00,882 --> 03:38:02,258
Got to go, dawg!

2475
03:38:21,694 --> 03:38:22,779
Yes!

2476
03:38:34,582 --> 03:38:35,625
I can smell you!

2477
03:38:36,084 --> 03:38:37,752
Yo, Jimmy, hit it, baby!

2478
03:38:43,174 --> 03:38:45,051
All right. Y'all see that?

2479
03:38:46,177 --> 03:38:48,137
I told y'all I had a surprise.

2480
03:38:48,429 --> 03:38:50,765
How you like that for a finale?

2481
03:39:00,233 --> 03:39:01,276
Bridge.

2482
03:39:43,318 --> 03:39:44,444
Yeah!

2483
03:39:48,740 --> 03:39:49,782
Shit!

2484
03:40:00,084 --> 03:40:01,586
Oh, hell, no!

2485
03:40:06,758 --> 03:40:08,176
Smack that ass!

2486
03:40:32,700 --> 03:40:33,743
Yes!

2487
03:40:42,919 --> 03:40:45,880
I saw that, man.
Bullitt and Suki sprayed the bridge.

2488
03:40:46,172 --> 03:40:48,883
I need to start making
y'all pay to see this shit.

2489
03:40:48,966 --> 03:40:51,719
I got over $10,000
for my man here, all right?

2490
03:40:52,053 --> 03:40:54,972
That's what I'm talking about, man.
Play with it.

2491
03:40:55,556 --> 03:40:57,934
- Smells good, don't it?
- How about that?

2492
03:40:58,017 --> 03:41:00,520
Right. Y'all see this?
Everybody take a good look.

2493
03:41:00,603 --> 03:41:03,898
This is what you call mutual
respect. All right, let's clear out.

2494
03:41:04,732 --> 03:41:06,734
Anybody down for another race?

2495
03:41:08,027 --> 03:41:09,070
Shit.

2496
03:41:13,407 --> 03:41:16,119
Make sure you bring that body
by the garage later...

2497
03:41:16,202 --> 03:41:19,705
so we can work
on that front end of yours.

2498
03:41:20,873 --> 03:41:21,999
Watch out.

2499
03:41:23,126 --> 03:41:24,627
Maybe I will.

2500
03:41:32,343 --> 03:41:33,886
Where are you going?

2501
03:41:34,720 --> 03:41:37,181
- Time to get out of here.
- Why is that?

2502
03:42:11,215 --> 03:42:12,925
Nissan Skyline! Got him!

2503
03:42:23,227 --> 03:42:24,812
Shit!

2504
03:42:48,294 --> 03:42:49,462
Damn!

2505
03:42:57,470 --> 03:42:59,680
Let me see your hands!
Put them up!

2506
03:43:00,765 --> 03:43:02,475
Yeah, this is him.
We got him.

2507
03:43:13,652 --> 03:43:17,698
So, how long
you been in South Florida?

2508
03:43:17,782 --> 03:43:19,700
A while.
Before that?

2509
03:43:22,995 --> 03:43:26,082
We know you're Brian O'Conner,
formerly of the LAPD.

2510
03:43:26,957 --> 03:43:29,043
- You got the wrong guy.
- Really?

2511
03:43:34,006 --> 03:43:35,758
How you doing, O'Conner?

2512
03:43:39,053 --> 03:43:40,513
Let's take a walk.

2513
03:43:43,432 --> 03:43:44,683
Carter Verone.

2514
03:43:45,142 --> 03:43:48,354
Born in Argentina, but he's lived
most of his life in Miami.

2515
03:43:48,854 --> 03:43:51,941
Now he owns the biggest
import-export business in the state.

2516
03:43:52,024 --> 03:43:55,778
Unfortunately, the cartels have been
successful getting drugs into Miami.

2517
03:43:55,861 --> 03:43:58,322
But they've had a hard time
getting the cash out.

2518
03:43:58,406 --> 03:44:00,199
We've surveilled him for a year.

2519
03:44:00,282 --> 03:44:02,993
But we haven't been able to put him
and the money together.

2520
03:44:03,077 --> 03:44:05,788
- We've swept his house, warehouses-
- Nothing.

2521
03:44:06,247 --> 03:44:09,166
Customs here has done a great job
of getting us this far.

2522
03:44:09,250 --> 03:44:11,293
I'm here to help get them
over the top.

2523
03:44:11,377 --> 03:44:13,671
I was able to get
an agent in undercover...

2524
03:44:13,754 --> 03:44:16,006
working travel and
logistics for him.

2525
03:44:16,132 --> 03:44:18,759
Verone's put her in charge
of finding new drivers.

2526
03:44:18,843 --> 03:44:22,304
Right, although we can't confirm
her status right now.

2527
03:44:22,680 --> 03:44:26,267
- You think she's flipped?
- She's one of mine. She's all right.

2528
03:44:26,350 --> 03:44:30,437
She's been in with Verone a year.
Even lives at the compound with him.

2529
03:44:30,521 --> 03:44:34,650
Look, it was the FBI's idea
to bring you in. I'm against it.

2530
03:44:34,942 --> 03:44:38,821
But we need good drivers to put
this asshole and his money together.

2531
03:44:39,113 --> 03:44:41,282
You're gonna roll with Agent Dunn.

2532
03:44:41,824 --> 03:44:43,117
And if I don't?

2533
03:44:43,576 --> 03:44:46,245
Here's a list of the laws
you broke in L.A.

2534
03:44:46,662 --> 03:44:50,040
Obstruction of justice, aiding and
abetting. You know the rap sheet.

2535
03:44:50,124 --> 03:44:53,711
We can make this all go away
in the interest of justice...

2536
03:44:54,461 --> 03:44:56,630
if you're willing to play ball.

2537
03:44:59,758 --> 03:45:03,721
What's the idea here? Dunn and I
are supposed to be street racers?

2538
03:45:03,846 --> 03:45:05,139
That's right.

2539
03:45:11,228 --> 03:45:12,438
So, Dunn...

2540
03:45:15,441 --> 03:45:17,693
looks like we're
going to be partners, bro.

2541
03:45:17,776 --> 03:45:19,653
Tell me, what would be
a better motor...

2542
03:45:19,737 --> 03:45:22,323
for my Skyline,
a Gallo 12 or a Gallo 24?

2543
03:45:27,703 --> 03:45:28,954
Twenty four.

2544
03:45:30,039 --> 03:45:32,416
I didn't know
pizza places made motors.

2545
03:45:35,252 --> 03:45:37,546
See, man, come on, I can't do this.

2546
03:45:37,922 --> 03:45:42,092
If this is what you'll give me,
I'll take my chances in Chino.

2547
03:45:43,260 --> 03:45:44,970
We'll get someone else.

2548
03:45:45,971 --> 03:45:47,431
No way, man.

2549
03:45:49,475 --> 03:45:52,770
The only way I'll do this is
if I get to pick the driver.

2550
03:45:54,313 --> 03:45:56,982
All right, O'Conner.
Who you got in mind?

2551
03:45:57,566 --> 03:46:00,903
- A dude I grew up with in Barstow.
- Who's that?

2552
03:46:01,945 --> 03:46:03,238
Roman Pearce.

2553
03:46:27,805 --> 03:46:30,516
That him in the Monte Carlo?
That's him.

2554
03:46:32,142 --> 03:46:34,019
He's got some skills.

2555
03:46:34,353 --> 03:46:36,855
And he's crazy as hell,
I'm telling you.

2556
03:46:37,898 --> 03:46:40,317
In a good way, though.
He's the man for the job.

2557
03:46:45,489 --> 03:46:48,784
And he has quite a record,
including three years upstate.

2558
03:46:49,243 --> 03:46:51,245
Says here,
he's on house arrest now.

2559
03:46:51,328 --> 03:46:53,914
Can't go more than
100 yards from his home.

2560
03:47:32,202 --> 03:47:34,163
He always said he'd be famous.

2561
03:47:38,625 --> 03:47:39,877
Pearce!

2562
03:47:41,128 --> 03:47:42,504
Roman Pearce!

2563
03:47:44,131 --> 03:47:46,466
Whatever happens next,
just let it go.

2564
03:47:46,717 --> 03:47:47,968
I ain't in it.

2565
03:47:51,221 --> 03:47:52,389
Rome!

2566
03:47:58,562 --> 03:48:00,981
Only my homeboys call me Rome...

2567
03:48:01,481 --> 03:48:02,608
pig.

2568
03:48:06,820 --> 03:48:09,531
- I'm not a cop anymore.
- Is that true?

2569
03:48:11,658 --> 03:48:13,327
Blondie here is not a cop anymore?

2570
03:48:13,368 --> 03:48:15,704
That's true. No badge.

2571
03:48:27,549 --> 03:48:29,176
Here we go.

2572
03:48:40,187 --> 03:48:43,148
You still fight like shit.

2573
03:48:44,316 --> 03:48:46,151
You better chill.

2574
03:48:47,110 --> 03:48:49,529
- Why are you here?
- I'll choke you.

2575
03:48:49,613 --> 03:48:51,740
I told you to stay away from me.

2576
03:48:55,994 --> 03:48:59,039
You should have told me.
I did three years, Brian.

2577
03:48:59,122 --> 03:49:00,832
I told you it wasn't my fault.

2578
03:49:10,884 --> 03:49:12,678
Why did you come here?

2579
03:49:16,765 --> 03:49:18,433
I got a deal for you.

2580
03:49:22,270 --> 03:49:25,315
When I needed your ass,
you were nowhere to be found.

2581
03:49:27,025 --> 03:49:29,277
Now you're trying to hand out deals?

2582
03:49:32,531 --> 03:49:34,741
I need you to come to Miami
and drive with me.

2583
03:49:34,825 --> 03:49:38,120
If you do, they'll take off
that anklet and clear your record.

2584
03:49:38,203 --> 03:49:40,330
I did three years in jail.

2585
03:49:41,206 --> 03:49:43,125
Three years over you, Brian.

2586
03:49:44,126 --> 03:49:46,962
- I know you better than you think.
- Maybe you don't.

2587
03:49:47,045 --> 03:49:48,588
Maybe you don't.

2588
03:49:49,464 --> 03:49:51,007
You guys finished?

2589
03:49:51,883 --> 03:49:53,552
Is this deal legit?

2590
03:49:54,136 --> 03:49:56,638
That's right.
If you do this job for us.

2591
03:49:56,972 --> 03:49:59,224
- I told you.
- Shut up, punk.

2592
03:50:01,017 --> 03:50:04,813
So you'll clean my record
and get this thing off my ankle.

2593
03:50:04,896 --> 03:50:06,189
That's right.

2594
03:50:06,773 --> 03:50:10,068
I thought you couldn't wander
more than 100 yards from your home.

2595
03:50:10,152 --> 03:50:12,737
Why do you think
I'm parked so close to the derby?

2596
03:50:12,821 --> 03:50:15,157
Quit playing
like you'll pass this up.

2597
03:50:16,783 --> 03:50:18,326
You stupid...

2598
03:50:47,939 --> 03:50:49,274
Wait. Hold on.

2599
03:50:51,693 --> 03:50:53,361
Bro, what's going on?

2600
03:50:54,029 --> 03:50:56,698
I don't know if
I should be trusting you, man.

2601
03:50:59,784 --> 03:51:03,872
Think of it this way. It's a chance
for a fresh start. Let's do this.

2602
03:51:03,955 --> 03:51:07,000
I wouldn't need a fresh start
if it wasn't for you.

2603
03:51:07,334 --> 03:51:09,586
You've been using that
since you got busted.

2604
03:51:09,669 --> 03:51:13,048
- Let's just chill out and do this.
- I don't need to chill out.

2605
03:51:13,131 --> 03:51:16,426
Yes, you do. And you need to stop
blaming me for your mistakes.

2606
03:51:16,509 --> 03:51:19,804
Roman Pearce needs to start taking
responsibility for his actions.

2607
03:51:19,888 --> 03:51:23,433
- You need to go to hell.
- You need to go back to Barstow.

2608
03:51:26,144 --> 03:51:28,480
I'm not going back
to Barstow.

2609
03:51:39,115 --> 03:51:42,535
Brian O'Conner,
Roman Pearce, meet Monica Fuentes.

2610
03:51:42,619 --> 03:51:45,372
- They have background on Verone?
- They've been briefed.

2611
03:51:45,455 --> 03:51:47,749
Good.
All right, here's the deal.

2612
03:51:47,832 --> 03:51:50,919
Verone's looking for drivers.
I arranged for you two to join.

2613
03:51:51,002 --> 03:51:53,296
I also hired some thugs
to make it legit.

2614
03:51:53,380 --> 03:51:55,548
- When do we start?
- Right now.

2615
03:51:56,007 --> 03:51:57,550
What are we driving?

2616
03:52:04,849 --> 03:52:07,769
Don't even think about
taking the convertible.

2617
03:52:07,852 --> 03:52:09,813
It might loosen your mousse.

2618
03:52:10,063 --> 03:52:12,774
That's cool.
Too much chrome for me anyways.

2619
03:52:12,857 --> 03:52:17,487
Damn! Where do you all
confiscate these rims from, man?

2620
03:52:18,113 --> 03:52:20,365
Check in with us after you meet him.

2621
03:52:21,950 --> 03:52:24,995
- You okay with these knuckleheads?
- I can handle them.

2622
03:52:25,078 --> 03:52:28,123
- If they trouble you, let me know.
- Thanks, Markham.

2623
03:52:31,543 --> 03:52:33,211
I ride with you, cowboy.

2624
03:52:33,878 --> 03:52:35,422
Why she gotta ride with you?

2625
03:52:35,505 --> 03:52:37,674
You get the convertible.
Let's go.

2626
03:52:52,188 --> 03:52:53,565
Turn right here.

2627
03:52:58,153 --> 03:53:00,739
- So, you used to be a cop?
- Yeah.

2628
03:53:02,407 --> 03:53:04,159
How long you been under?

2629
03:53:04,993 --> 03:53:06,327
I lost track.

2630
03:53:07,162 --> 03:53:08,413
You all right?

2631
03:53:10,457 --> 03:53:13,585
You might want to keep
your eyes on the road, playboy.

2632
03:53:13,960 --> 03:53:16,963
- You think we're gonna crash?
- I haven't decided yet.

2633
03:53:21,801 --> 03:53:23,636
What are you doing, Brian?

2634
03:53:33,354 --> 03:53:36,900
He did the "stare and drive" on you,
didn't he? He got that from me.

2635
03:54:12,268 --> 03:54:14,604
Once we get in here,
you're on your own.

2636
03:54:26,491 --> 03:54:27,909
Look at that one.

2637
03:54:28,326 --> 03:54:31,621
Where'd you get them cars?
At the bottom of a cereal box?

2638
03:54:33,831 --> 03:54:35,875
Real funny, Fonzie.

2639
03:54:37,293 --> 03:54:38,461
Ass.

2640
03:54:38,670 --> 03:54:41,422
Roberto, Enrique,
I need pictures of the drivers...

2641
03:54:41,506 --> 03:54:44,342
their license plates, cars,
and anything else you can find.

2642
03:54:57,397 --> 03:54:58,731
Let's go.

2643
03:55:01,734 --> 03:55:04,487
Keep your mouth shut
and follow my lead, all right?

2644
03:55:04,570 --> 03:55:07,573
- I got this.
- No, I'm serious.

2645
03:55:08,950 --> 03:55:11,327
Handle your business.
I'll handle mine.

2646
03:55:15,039 --> 03:55:16,833
Watch your hands, bruh.

2647
03:55:19,877 --> 03:55:21,212
Go in line.

2648
03:55:21,295 --> 03:55:22,755
Let's go.

2649
03:55:31,931 --> 03:55:33,099
Carter.

2650
03:55:40,648 --> 03:55:42,567
The drivers are here.
Good.

2651
03:55:42,900 --> 03:55:44,068
Come on.

2652
03:55:48,364 --> 03:55:49,449
Stay.

2653
03:55:51,784 --> 03:55:53,828
What's going on here?
Tell me.

2654
03:55:54,829 --> 03:55:57,373
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

2655
03:55:58,791 --> 03:56:00,918
My red Ferrari was confiscated.

2656
03:56:01,002 --> 03:56:03,546
It sits in an impound lot
in Little Haiti.

2657
03:56:03,921 --> 03:56:05,923
It's about 20 miles from here.

2658
03:56:06,215 --> 03:56:10,344
The car isn't important. The package
I left in the glove box is.

2659
03:56:10,428 --> 03:56:12,847
The first team back here
with the package...

2660
03:56:12,930 --> 03:56:15,016
will have an opportunity
to work for me.

2661
03:56:15,099 --> 03:56:17,268
What are you saying?
We got to audition?

2662
03:56:17,435 --> 03:56:19,479
Nobody has a gun to your head.

2663
03:56:21,898 --> 03:56:23,232
That's it.

2664
03:56:24,150 --> 03:56:26,569
Driver's licenses. Pass them up.

2665
03:56:28,488 --> 03:56:29,822
Before Christmas, guys.

2666
03:56:33,367 --> 03:56:34,702
Let's go!

2667
03:56:54,472 --> 03:56:55,723
Come on, cuz!

2668
03:56:58,976 --> 03:57:00,811
Let's see what this thing can do.

2669
03:57:17,495 --> 03:57:20,122
Agent Markham.
They're heading south on I-95.

2670
03:57:20,206 --> 03:57:21,541
I got it.

2671
03:57:22,166 --> 03:57:24,377
They're running. What a surprise.

2672
03:57:35,054 --> 03:57:36,597
Stick with me, Rome.

2673
03:57:45,523 --> 03:57:47,275
Why must I chase the cat?

2674
03:58:01,622 --> 03:58:02,873
Smart-ass.

2675
03:58:10,548 --> 03:58:12,633
You think you're the bomb, Rome?

2676
03:58:51,672 --> 03:58:53,841
Let's see if you still got it.

2677
03:58:55,801 --> 03:58:57,803
I got something for your ass.

2678
03:59:04,185 --> 03:59:05,519
Watch this, bro.

2679
03:59:14,487 --> 03:59:15,654
Shit.

2680
03:59:16,697 --> 03:59:18,866
How do you like them apples?

2681
03:59:19,116 --> 03:59:20,367
Show-off!

2682
03:59:20,951 --> 03:59:23,913
That's the Brian O'Conner
school of driving, baby!

2683
03:59:28,542 --> 03:59:30,252
Crazy-ass white boy!

2684
03:59:31,295 --> 03:59:32,463
Shit!

2685
04:00:01,367 --> 04:00:02,993
Bumbaclot.

2686
04:00:05,037 --> 04:00:07,164
You better get out
of the street!

2687
04:00:07,248 --> 04:00:08,916
That's some bad shit.

2688
04:00:18,592 --> 04:00:19,885
What do we got?

2689
04:00:23,097 --> 04:00:24,848
That's good. Show me his partner.

2690
04:00:28,936 --> 04:00:30,437
Where are the cars?

2691
04:00:36,860 --> 04:00:39,029
Stinking boats. Where are the cars?

2692
04:00:49,790 --> 04:00:51,959
I need the cars.
Where are the cars at?

2693
04:01:22,364 --> 04:01:24,366
Look in the center.
What?

2694
04:01:27,036 --> 04:01:28,203
Cha-ching!

2695
04:01:28,537 --> 04:01:30,831
- Now put your blouse back on.
- Hater.

2696
04:01:39,882 --> 04:01:41,050
Shit!

2697
04:01:45,512 --> 04:01:47,389
- Don't let him get away.
- Not a problem.

2698
04:01:47,473 --> 04:01:49,683
Sit on it, Fonzie!

2699
04:01:50,893 --> 04:01:52,186
What the hell?

2700
04:01:52,603 --> 04:01:53,812
Shit. Cops.

2701
04:01:54,521 --> 04:01:55,814
What are they doing here?

2702
04:01:55,856 --> 04:01:57,608
Rome, no!

2703
04:02:00,819 --> 04:02:02,404
Time to go.

2704
04:02:06,700 --> 04:02:07,868
Son of a bitch!

2705
04:02:07,951 --> 04:02:11,121
Juvy record
for popping cars. Two years in J.D.

2706
04:02:11,205 --> 04:02:13,999
Another year for aiding and abetting
an armed robbery.

2707
04:02:14,249 --> 04:02:17,086
He's clean. Dirty, but clean.

2708
04:02:19,004 --> 04:02:20,089
All right.

2709
04:02:40,776 --> 04:02:43,946
Hey, man. You got something
to eat up in there?

2710
04:02:44,738 --> 04:02:46,114
We hungry.

2711
04:02:50,035 --> 04:02:51,912
Sit them by the pool.

2712
04:02:52,704 --> 04:02:54,248
Nice. Come on.

2713
04:03:03,465 --> 04:03:07,010
- What are you checking her out for?
- I'm not checking her out.

2714
04:03:11,098 --> 04:03:13,392
- Yes, you were.
- No, I wasn't.

2715
04:03:14,184 --> 04:03:17,813
- I seen you checking her out.
- Okay, I was. Now shut up.

2716
04:03:17,896 --> 04:03:20,399
You shut up.
Don't tell me to shut up.

2717
04:03:20,482 --> 04:03:23,694
Both you girlies shut up.
Unbelievable.

2718
04:03:35,122 --> 04:03:38,041
You sure are cozy
in this big old mansion.

2719
04:03:40,460 --> 04:03:42,504
Sleeping with the enemy.

2720
04:03:48,051 --> 04:03:49,761
No, no. Sit down.

2721
04:03:51,096 --> 04:03:53,432
Nice Ferrari you got
in the driveway.

2722
04:03:55,601 --> 04:03:57,477
I'm glad you like it.

2723
04:04:02,024 --> 04:04:03,900
Darling, will you hold that?

2724
04:04:12,492 --> 04:04:14,786
We did all that for a damn cigar?

2725
04:04:15,287 --> 04:04:17,622
No. You did that for a job.

2726
04:04:24,379 --> 04:04:28,216
Do you really think that
I would let somebody impound my car?

2727
04:04:32,429 --> 04:04:34,139
The boatyard is mine.

2728
04:04:35,057 --> 04:04:37,392
By the way, you two owe me a gate.

2729
04:04:37,809 --> 04:04:39,644
I'll take it off your cut.

2730
04:04:42,481 --> 04:04:44,274
- Off our cut?
- Yeah.

2731
04:04:45,776 --> 04:04:47,569
I like that.
Good.

2732
04:04:48,028 --> 04:04:50,447
What's this job
you got for us, anyway?

2733
04:04:50,572 --> 04:04:51,740
Come with me.

2734
04:04:51,823 --> 04:04:53,658
The house has ears in it.

2735
04:04:55,786 --> 04:04:59,664
I have something I want you to carry
from North Beach to the Keys.

2736
04:04:59,748 --> 04:05:00,957
What is it?

2737
04:05:01,041 --> 04:05:03,001
Just put it in the car,
drive it to me...

2738
04:05:03,043 --> 04:05:05,837
and don't let anybody
stop you. Understand?

2739
04:05:06,254 --> 04:05:07,839
Any chance of cop trouble?

2740
04:05:07,923 --> 04:05:11,760
I'm buying you a window of time,
but it won't be open very long.

2741
04:05:13,720 --> 04:05:15,263
You make it...

2742
04:05:16,473 --> 04:05:19,768
and I'll personally hand you
$100,000 at the finish line.

2743
04:05:20,268 --> 04:05:22,604
Make it $100,000 apiece.

2744
04:05:24,856 --> 04:05:26,316
Look, man...

2745
04:05:27,150 --> 04:05:28,610
obviously...

2746
04:05:30,028 --> 04:05:31,905
your pockets ain't nervous.

2747
04:05:33,115 --> 04:05:35,534
- Don't ever touch me.
- Ours are empty.

2748
04:05:37,244 --> 04:05:38,787
Like I said...

2749
04:05:39,579 --> 04:05:40,956
we hungry.

2750
04:05:50,924 --> 04:05:55,387
I got an idea. Why don't you boys
join us at the club later tonight?

2751
04:05:55,595 --> 04:05:57,472
Yeah. Pearl at midnight?

2752
04:05:57,556 --> 04:06:00,517
- Get to know each other better.
- Sounds good.

2753
04:06:02,143 --> 04:06:04,187
See you tonight.
See you.

2754
04:06:07,941 --> 04:06:09,276
Hey, you!

2755
04:06:12,028 --> 04:06:14,948
- Your pockets aren't empty.
- Damn.

2756
04:06:15,574 --> 04:06:17,450
I'll take my cutter back.

2757
04:06:24,291 --> 04:06:25,709
Stupid ass.

2758
04:06:27,210 --> 04:06:30,881
Hey, man, I figured you
had 12 or 13 of these.

2759
04:06:30,964 --> 04:06:33,341
You're not too bright.
Get out of here.

2760
04:06:34,259 --> 04:06:37,512
- You're doing the same stupid shit.
- Get off me.

2761
04:06:37,721 --> 04:06:41,600
Look, running your mouth?
Insulting people? Stealing his shit?

2762
04:06:41,975 --> 04:06:44,394
You think I'd let someone
stare me down?

2763
04:06:44,477 --> 04:06:47,230
I didn't let nobody
stare me down in jail, homeboy.

2764
04:06:47,314 --> 04:06:49,858
You think I'm gonna
let it fly on a beach?

2765
04:06:50,567 --> 04:06:53,194
"And you, I'll take my cutter back. "

2766
04:06:53,528 --> 04:06:55,030
His rich ass.

2767
04:06:55,739 --> 04:06:58,366
- And you're packing.
- Like you ain't.

2768
04:07:00,785 --> 04:07:02,078
Exactly.

2769
04:07:02,245 --> 04:07:05,999
- From here on, I do the talking.
- You want to do more than that.

2770
04:07:06,082 --> 04:07:07,500
What does that mean?

2771
04:07:07,584 --> 04:07:11,379
It means you always get in trouble
over a female, Brian.

2772
04:07:22,974 --> 04:07:25,810
Tej's garage is ridiculous.
He has everything.

2773
04:07:25,894 --> 04:07:30,190
Snap-on tools. These lifts are new.
They're only a couple of months old.

2774
04:07:30,273 --> 04:07:33,109
- Jimmy. What's up, man?
- What's up, Bullitt?

2775
04:07:33,193 --> 04:07:35,070
That's Rome there. Do me a favor.

2776
04:07:35,153 --> 04:07:38,782
When you get a second, I want you
to check out the Evo and Spyder.

2777
04:07:38,865 --> 04:07:40,784
Where'd you get an Evo from?

2778
04:07:40,867 --> 04:07:43,119
- It's a long story.
- I got you, man.

2779
04:07:43,203 --> 04:07:44,746
Thanks, Jimmy.

2780
04:07:45,038 --> 04:07:48,041
It's so hot and humid,
I can't even wear drawers.

2781
04:07:48,124 --> 04:07:49,834
Tell me about it.

2782
04:07:50,585 --> 04:07:53,004
Look at all this potential out here.

2783
04:07:53,088 --> 04:07:56,383
Ray, don't do that, man.
You're making me lose money.

2784
04:07:57,550 --> 04:08:00,512
Come on, stop that.
I know you're better than that.

2785
04:08:02,263 --> 04:08:03,431
Damn.

2786
04:08:15,693 --> 04:08:19,447
Your boy can help put that fire out!
Look at the bubble-

2787
04:08:20,615 --> 04:08:22,117
Let's go.
Serious.

2788
04:08:22,200 --> 04:08:24,035
Ray, you're making me
lose money.

2789
04:08:24,119 --> 04:08:26,704
Don't do that.
Don't do that to me, now.

2790
04:08:26,788 --> 04:08:28,331
Come on, Ray. Do it.

2791
04:08:28,998 --> 04:08:32,168
Tej Parker? This is Roman Pearce.

2792
04:08:34,420 --> 04:08:38,716
Basically, he's the man to know in
Miami. Has his finger in everything.

2793
04:08:38,883 --> 04:08:40,802
It's just the way it is.

2794
04:08:41,010 --> 04:08:42,846
- What's going on?
- What's up?

2795
04:08:42,929 --> 04:08:44,430
- How you doing?
- Good.

2796
04:08:44,514 --> 04:08:46,266
What's this?
What's the latest?

2797
04:08:47,976 --> 04:08:50,395
It's a work in progress.
It's not finished.

2798
04:08:50,478 --> 04:08:53,231
That's some artistic shit.
You got talent.

2799
04:08:53,314 --> 04:08:56,943
Ray, it's do or die now!
Bring it home, Ray!

2800
04:08:58,194 --> 04:08:59,612
Yeah, baby!

2801
04:08:59,904 --> 04:09:01,573
Pay up! Pay up!

2802
04:09:03,032 --> 04:09:04,826
That's how they do it out here?

2803
04:09:04,909 --> 04:09:07,078
- Every day.
- That's crazy.

2804
04:09:07,162 --> 04:09:10,415
Right here. Right now.
You don't look too happy.

2805
04:09:10,832 --> 04:09:14,961
Expeditiously, man. I need it quick.
Thank you. Thank you.

2806
04:09:15,253 --> 04:09:19,090
How you feeling, man?
You all right? Thank you.

2807
04:09:20,717 --> 04:09:22,176
Not too bad.

2808
04:09:24,387 --> 04:09:27,849
I see you're about your money,
homey. You race, too?

2809
04:09:29,392 --> 04:09:33,563
No, man. I hit a wall doing
like a buck 20 a couple years ago.

2810
04:09:33,855 --> 04:09:36,774
Ever since then, I've just been
organizing and collecting.

2811
04:09:36,858 --> 04:09:40,737
Check it out. He'll be in town
a while. Can he use that cot?

2812
04:09:42,196 --> 04:09:44,282
What's wrong with your place?

2813
04:09:45,408 --> 04:09:48,411
I don't want to stay with him.
He has bad habits.

2814
04:09:49,996 --> 04:09:53,791
All right. Show him around.
I'll be up there in a minute.

2815
04:09:53,875 --> 04:09:55,209
- Thanks.
- Sure.

2816
04:09:56,419 --> 04:09:59,005
Who wants a chance
to win their money back?

2817
04:09:59,839 --> 04:10:03,134
So, Jimmy? You ever seen
anything like this before?

2818
04:10:03,343 --> 04:10:06,721
No. Both of them
are wired like I never seen before.

2819
04:10:06,804 --> 04:10:07,972
What?

2820
04:10:08,056 --> 04:10:09,849
They got us wired with GPS.

2821
04:10:09,932 --> 04:10:12,977
That's why Markham knew
we were at that impound lot.

2822
04:10:13,770 --> 04:10:17,315
You the master mechanic.
Can't you just yank that shit out?

2823
04:10:17,565 --> 04:10:19,859
I'll try, but this ain't LoJack.

2824
04:10:19,984 --> 04:10:23,946
The DIS box, the engine management
system, the main harness...

2825
04:10:24,113 --> 04:10:26,032
The GPS is spidered into all that.

2826
04:10:26,115 --> 04:10:27,659
Tell me something, man.

2827
04:10:27,784 --> 04:10:30,244
Do I even want to know
where the Skyline is, dawg?

2828
04:10:30,328 --> 04:10:34,082
Or where you've been or where
the hell you got these rides from?

2829
04:10:34,749 --> 04:10:36,751
- They're hot.
- Yeah, they hot.

2830
04:10:36,834 --> 04:10:40,963
Wired so hot, anyone tracking them
knows if you wear your seat belt.

2831
04:10:44,133 --> 04:10:45,468
All right, Jimmy.

2832
04:10:45,551 --> 04:10:48,012
- Just do what you can do, bro.
- I got you.

2833
04:10:48,096 --> 04:10:49,430
Thanks, man.

2834
04:10:49,597 --> 04:10:52,183
We need to get these
on the street ASAP.

2835
04:10:53,393 --> 04:10:54,894
Check it out.

2836
04:10:55,186 --> 04:10:57,814
See that Cadillac across the street?

2837
04:11:02,652 --> 04:11:05,530
They've been on us
since we left Verone's house.

2838
04:11:15,415 --> 04:11:18,751
Elian and Fidel!

2839
04:11:19,919 --> 04:11:21,879
Can I clean your windshield?

2840
04:11:21,963 --> 04:11:23,798
What are you doing, man?

2841
04:11:26,426 --> 04:11:27,969
Is everything copasetic?

2842
04:11:29,929 --> 04:11:31,597
Kiss my ass.

2843
04:11:33,141 --> 04:11:34,308
Shit.

2844
04:11:37,228 --> 04:11:38,563
Let's go!

2845
04:11:44,277 --> 04:11:47,071
He'll blow our cover
before we even get started.

2846
04:11:47,405 --> 04:11:50,658
- What went wrong?
- That's what I want to know.

2847
04:11:50,741 --> 04:11:52,869
Show me your hands.
Keep them up!

2848
04:11:52,952 --> 04:11:55,079
- What's this about?
- What's going on?

2849
04:11:55,163 --> 04:11:58,541
Hold this. You think you can
shoot at me? I'm a federal agent.

2850
04:11:58,624 --> 04:11:59,750
What are you talking about?

2851
04:11:59,834 --> 04:12:02,837
Get your damn hands off me!
Get him away from me, dawg!

2852
04:12:02,920 --> 04:12:06,090
'Cause you wear a badge doesn't mean
you can mess shit up for us!

2853
04:12:06,174 --> 04:12:07,884
Get your hands off me!

2854
04:12:07,967 --> 04:12:10,094
- Lucky I didn't shoot you!
- Shut up!

2855
04:12:10,178 --> 04:12:11,846
Don't tell me to shut up!

2856
04:12:11,929 --> 04:12:14,265
You almost blew our cover, old man!

2857
04:12:14,348 --> 04:12:16,392
You shouldn't have shown up
like you did.

2858
04:12:16,475 --> 04:12:18,477
You didn't know
Verone was testing us?

2859
04:12:18,561 --> 04:12:20,688
I thought you punks were running!

2860
04:12:20,771 --> 04:12:23,065
That's great. That's real great!

2861
04:12:23,149 --> 04:12:26,986
And if Rome wanted to shoot you?
You wouldn't be here right now.

2862
04:12:27,570 --> 04:12:29,864
We got to get this under control.

2863
04:12:34,827 --> 04:12:36,287
That's mine!

2864
04:12:36,454 --> 04:12:37,622
So?

2865
04:12:38,581 --> 04:12:42,209
- Tell me what you know.
- We're making a run for Verone.

2866
04:12:42,293 --> 04:12:44,128
I'm not sure when or where...

2867
04:12:44,211 --> 04:12:47,632
but he said he bought us a window,
I assume from the local cops.

2868
04:12:47,715 --> 04:12:50,217
I can talk to some guys
at the local P.D.

2869
04:12:50,551 --> 04:12:53,387
No good. If Verone has some
of them on payroll...

2870
04:12:53,471 --> 04:12:55,723
we can't let
them know our operation.

2871
04:12:55,806 --> 04:12:57,099
Exactly.

2872
04:12:57,475 --> 04:13:01,604
In addition, Verone told us that
he himself will be at the drop.

2873
04:13:01,771 --> 04:13:03,481
That's good news.

2874
04:13:03,814 --> 04:13:07,610
If you're delivering drug money,
we can get him for laundering.

2875
04:13:07,777 --> 04:13:10,112
- Now, there's only one problem.
- What's that?

2876
04:13:10,196 --> 04:13:11,489
Fuentes.

2877
04:13:11,822 --> 04:13:13,991
- Verone's tapping her.
- Tapping her?

2878
04:13:14,325 --> 04:13:16,410
- Tapping her how?
- That is crap.

2879
04:13:16,494 --> 04:13:18,871
What you talking about?
We know what we seen.

2880
04:13:18,955 --> 04:13:23,084
What do you think, O'Conner?
She's compromised? You should know.

2881
04:13:23,501 --> 04:13:26,879
- What does that mean?
- Your pal O'Conner didn't tell you?

2882
04:13:26,963 --> 04:13:29,006
He flipped on Bilkins in L.A.

2883
04:13:29,090 --> 04:13:32,009
He gave his mark his car keys
and let him disappear.

2884
04:13:32,093 --> 04:13:34,428
That's why he's not a cop anymore.

2885
04:13:36,555 --> 04:13:38,849
So what do you think, expert?

2886
04:13:40,101 --> 04:13:41,352
I don't know.

2887
04:13:41,435 --> 04:13:43,771
All right. We'll keep an eye on her.

2888
04:13:45,272 --> 04:13:47,024
We're out of here.

2889
04:13:53,823 --> 04:13:55,491
Let your man go?

2890
04:13:56,033 --> 04:13:57,868
Drop it.
I don't wanna talk about it.

2891
04:13:57,952 --> 04:14:00,830
Drop it, hell.
I want to hear about this, homey.

2892
04:14:01,080 --> 04:14:02,915
Forget about it, cuz.

2893
04:14:02,998 --> 04:14:05,126
We got Fuentes in with Verone...

2894
04:14:05,918 --> 04:14:07,878
Markham trying to blow our cover...

2895
04:14:07,962 --> 04:14:12,049
and we got two wired cars no better
than that ankle bracelet of mine.

2896
04:14:12,133 --> 04:14:16,262
I'll tell you, bruh, you let Markham
do that again in front of Verone...

2897
04:14:16,345 --> 04:14:17,722
that'll be our ass!

2898
04:14:17,805 --> 04:14:20,015
I know, man.
It's getting thick real quick.

2899
04:14:20,099 --> 04:14:22,852
We need a way out, got to
come up with an exit strategy.

2900
04:14:22,935 --> 04:14:24,812
- Exit strategy?
- Yeah.

2901
04:14:27,690 --> 04:14:30,151
I like the way that sounds.
What you got in mind?

2902
04:14:30,234 --> 04:14:33,279
I don't know.
But we need two more cars.

2903
04:14:41,078 --> 04:14:42,663
Here they come.

2904
04:15:01,807 --> 04:15:05,060
Fonzie and Fabio.
Glad you could join us.

2905
04:15:06,061 --> 04:15:09,064
We hear you want to get rid
of those Cracker Jack toys.

2906
04:15:09,148 --> 04:15:10,649
No, we figured your cars...

2907
04:15:10,733 --> 04:15:13,903
deserve better drivers,
so we'll take them off your hands.

2908
04:15:13,986 --> 04:15:15,529
Why don't we settle this now?

2909
04:15:15,613 --> 04:15:18,407
Wait. How about we settle
this on the blacktop?

2910
04:15:18,741 --> 04:15:22,536
Each car does a down-and-back,
tag-team style. For slips.

2911
04:15:22,745 --> 04:15:24,246
Loser walks home.

2912
04:15:24,330 --> 04:15:26,957
- We came to race.
- Load them up then.

2913
04:15:30,711 --> 04:15:32,630
Let's get these cars.

2914
04:15:34,465 --> 04:15:38,010
Check it out. There's no way
we'll beat these guys straight up.

2915
04:15:38,093 --> 04:15:40,512
That Hemi's putting out about 425...

2916
04:15:40,638 --> 04:15:43,974
and that Yenko will snap
a speedo in five seconds flat.

2917
04:15:44,642 --> 04:15:46,769
We have to pull something
out of our ass.

2918
04:15:46,852 --> 04:15:50,189
I think we should save
the spray for the way back.

2919
04:15:50,898 --> 04:15:53,192
Done deal.
Let's do this, bro.

2920
04:15:53,359 --> 04:15:55,611
I'm getting that orange one.

2921
04:15:57,613 --> 04:15:59,657
You ain't ready, Fabio!

2922
04:16:03,994 --> 04:16:05,120
All right.

2923
04:16:05,245 --> 04:16:08,624
You each got a barrel to go around
down at the end of the road.

2924
04:16:08,999 --> 04:16:12,586
Second wave's got to sit tight till
your partner crosses this line here.

2925
04:16:12,670 --> 04:16:15,714
First team to go down and back twice
wins the race.

2926
04:16:16,048 --> 04:16:17,800
At which point...

2927
04:16:19,009 --> 04:16:22,554
the losers will hand over them keys.

2928
04:16:22,638 --> 04:16:26,141
Or you'll be eating breakfast
through straws from now on.

2929
04:16:29,561 --> 04:16:30,896
I get it.

2930
04:16:32,439 --> 04:16:34,316
This means you, too.

2931
04:16:35,150 --> 04:16:36,318
I got it.

2932
04:16:36,402 --> 04:16:38,487
All right. Let's race.

2933
04:16:42,783 --> 04:16:46,078
Come on, baby, you got this, Rome!
This dude ain't serious.

2934
04:16:46,161 --> 04:16:49,623
Yeah, you gone, homey.
I got this. This is done.

2935
04:16:51,208 --> 04:16:52,668
You about to lose your car.

2936
04:16:52,751 --> 04:16:54,878
- Do it, Rome!
- Come on, you got it, man.

2937
04:16:54,962 --> 04:16:59,174
Think I'm worried about this fool?
This is nothing!

2938
04:17:09,893 --> 04:17:12,104
- Oh, no.
- American muscle.

2939
04:17:14,857 --> 04:17:17,693
Your engine ain't as big
as your mouth.

2940
04:17:22,865 --> 04:17:25,534
Got to smoke him.

2941
04:17:25,617 --> 04:17:26,952
All right, here we go!

2942
04:17:27,035 --> 04:17:30,038
- It's all right, I'll handle this.
- Handle it.

2943
04:17:30,956 --> 04:17:33,917
Ready, and... go!

2944
04:17:40,382 --> 04:17:43,177
You ain't ready!
I run these streets!

2945
04:17:52,811 --> 04:17:55,397
Romey Rome! You ain't heard of me?

2946
04:18:13,290 --> 04:18:14,625
Oh, shit.

2947
04:18:19,379 --> 04:18:20,756
Oh, yeah!

2948
04:18:25,719 --> 04:18:27,471
I'm gonna get you.

2949
04:18:29,556 --> 04:18:31,266
Where's your big mouth now?

2950
04:18:31,350 --> 04:18:33,685
That car's going home with me.

2951
04:18:44,529 --> 04:18:46,782
Shit. Eat this, sucker!

2952
04:19:00,963 --> 04:19:02,130
Shit!

2953
04:19:06,426 --> 04:19:08,929
Yeah, boy! Go, Korpi!

2954
04:19:12,140 --> 04:19:15,060
Sorry, blondie,
how does that dust taste?

2955
04:19:17,479 --> 04:19:18,981
I don't know.

2956
04:19:19,982 --> 04:19:21,525
Come on, Rome.

2957
04:19:50,012 --> 04:19:51,304
What the...

2958
04:19:51,388 --> 04:19:54,433
Good move, kid.
Let's see if you got the balls.

2959
04:20:17,581 --> 04:20:18,915
Shit, come on.

2960
04:20:28,884 --> 04:20:31,094
Come on, Brian, bring it home, man!

2961
04:21:13,637 --> 04:21:15,472
We got two new cars!

2962
04:21:16,973 --> 04:21:18,141
Damn!

2963
04:21:25,398 --> 04:21:28,276
Y'all ain't ready!
Get to walking, Fabio!

2964
04:21:29,736 --> 04:21:31,738
Use them bus tokens!

2965
04:21:39,371 --> 04:21:41,373
How are you?
What's your name?

2966
04:21:41,456 --> 04:21:42,832
We're Mr. Verone's guests.

2967
04:21:53,176 --> 04:21:55,095
It's a hoasis in here.

2968
04:21:55,595 --> 04:21:58,098
Yeah, lots of potential.

2969
04:21:59,933 --> 04:22:02,227
Damn. You got a pen?

2970
04:22:05,397 --> 04:22:07,524
It's about to get serious.

2971
04:22:08,233 --> 04:22:10,694
Look at that girl on the swing.

2972
04:22:10,777 --> 04:22:14,906
You guys did something right.
He never socializes with hired help.

2973
04:22:14,990 --> 04:22:17,075
Now what's that make you?

2974
04:22:17,534 --> 04:22:19,869
- Where's he at?
- He's on his way.

2975
04:22:19,953 --> 04:22:22,122
You and Verone
don't go everywhere together?

2976
04:22:22,205 --> 04:22:25,000
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

2977
04:22:28,169 --> 04:22:31,131
- I'm gonna go take a piss.
- You go do that.

2978
04:22:35,552 --> 04:22:37,262
What is his deal?

2979
04:22:37,637 --> 04:22:39,764
He doesn't trust people
who carry badges.

2980
04:22:39,848 --> 04:22:41,850
You talk like you know.

2981
04:22:44,394 --> 04:22:48,898
I'd been a cop about two months when
Roman was busted in a garage raid.

2982
04:22:49,190 --> 04:22:52,861
He had eight sets of wheels
in his possession, each of them hot.

2983
04:22:52,944 --> 04:22:54,696
So you busted him?

2984
04:22:54,779 --> 04:22:58,908
I didn't know it was going down.
But that doesn't really matter.

2985
04:23:00,493 --> 04:23:05,165
Once I became a cop, Roman saw me
as a friend who became the enemy.

2986
04:23:11,588 --> 04:23:14,215
Is there anything I can get for you,
Mr. Verone?

2987
04:23:14,299 --> 04:23:16,342
Just tell them
to come join me.

2988
04:23:23,266 --> 04:23:25,101
I was admiring this.

2989
04:23:34,944 --> 04:23:36,112
Damn.

2990
04:23:36,529 --> 04:23:39,365
I'm not giving it to you. What's up?

2991
04:23:39,449 --> 04:23:40,825
He's here.

2992
04:23:41,326 --> 04:23:42,869
Where's he at?

2993
04:23:43,119 --> 04:23:44,662
He's over there. Don't look.

2994
04:23:48,708 --> 04:23:51,795
Excuse me, Mr. Verone
would like for you to join him.

2995
04:23:52,337 --> 04:23:53,797
Let's do it.

2996
04:23:54,339 --> 04:23:56,508
See what I'm talking about?

2997
04:23:59,844 --> 04:24:01,763
It's all right, let them in.

2998
04:24:04,349 --> 04:24:06,559
Go sit down,
I'll talk to you in a second.

2999
04:24:07,769 --> 04:24:09,979
- How you doing?
- Good. Enjoying your night?

3000
04:24:10,063 --> 04:24:12,398
- Yeah, I'm having a good time.
- Good.

3001
04:24:14,651 --> 04:24:16,528
She's beautiful, isn't she?

3002
04:24:23,284 --> 04:24:24,452
Yeah.

3003
04:24:25,328 --> 04:24:26,913
She's gorgeous.

3004
04:24:33,503 --> 04:24:35,296
You got balls, kid.

3005
04:24:36,339 --> 04:24:38,091
I appreciate that.

3006
04:24:39,050 --> 04:24:41,219
Women are a powerful force.

3007
04:24:42,845 --> 04:24:46,474
You see the blonde sitting
with the gentleman right here?

3008
04:24:50,478 --> 04:24:54,732
Five minutes of her time, and she
can get anything she wants from him.

3009
04:24:55,024 --> 04:24:56,651
I love your hair.

3010
04:24:56,734 --> 04:24:57,944
Watch.

3011
04:25:04,075 --> 04:25:06,786
I wonder where they're going?
Sit down.

3012
04:25:09,038 --> 04:25:12,417
So you lit my man's car on fire.
Is that right?

3013
04:25:14,210 --> 04:25:15,378
Yeah.

3014
04:25:16,421 --> 04:25:17,630
I did.

3015
04:25:19,507 --> 04:25:22,635
I got a problem with authority.

3016
04:25:24,929 --> 04:25:26,973
I have that same problem.

3017
04:25:27,515 --> 04:25:31,311
For me, it's cops in particular.

3018
04:25:43,573 --> 04:25:45,450
Let's take a walk. Come on.

3019
04:25:45,533 --> 04:25:48,453
We just got here.
And now we're leaving.

3020
04:25:49,329 --> 04:25:50,663
Let's go.

3021
04:25:58,796 --> 04:25:59,839
Hey.

3022
04:25:59,922 --> 04:26:01,049
Come on.

3023
04:26:23,613 --> 04:26:25,281
What's all that?

3024
04:26:27,492 --> 04:26:29,994
We're going to have a little fun.

3025
04:26:36,751 --> 04:26:38,127
Thank you.

3026
04:26:38,878 --> 04:26:43,299
- It'll be fun. Let's stay longer.
- Yeah.

3027
04:26:46,511 --> 04:26:47,762
Hey, Carter.

3028
04:26:48,221 --> 04:26:50,306
Meet Detective Whitworth.

3029
04:26:52,433 --> 04:26:54,352
One of Miami's finest.

3030
04:26:55,186 --> 04:26:57,021
Thank you, sweetheart.

3031
04:26:57,105 --> 04:26:58,898
You enjoying yourself, Detective?

3032
04:26:58,981 --> 04:27:00,441
Yeah, I was.

3033
04:27:01,275 --> 04:27:03,528
I mean, you know me.

3034
04:27:03,903 --> 04:27:05,071
Yeah.

3035
04:27:05,655 --> 04:27:07,198
I do know you.

3036
04:27:08,908 --> 04:27:10,910
You've been on my payroll
a long time.

3037
04:27:10,993 --> 04:27:13,579
- Verone, that ain't right.
- Shut up.

3038
04:27:15,289 --> 04:27:18,251
I've got one last job for you.
You hear me?

3039
04:27:18,334 --> 04:27:20,753
- We've been through this.
- Yeah?

3040
04:27:21,087 --> 04:27:22,964
And I said I can't do it.

3041
04:27:24,590 --> 04:27:27,176
That's the wrong answer.
The table.

3042
04:27:32,807 --> 04:27:34,809
I'm a detective, Verone!

3043
04:27:34,892 --> 04:27:38,980
You do anything to me, the whole
force'll be on your ass in a minute.

3044
04:27:39,063 --> 04:27:42,191
Shut your mouth,
you fat piece of shit.

3045
04:27:43,067 --> 04:27:44,652
Stop right now.

3046
04:27:50,867 --> 04:27:52,410
What the hell?

3047
04:27:52,618 --> 04:27:53,953
Sit down.

3048
04:27:54,579 --> 04:27:57,331
You're going to regret this.
Stop right now!

3049
04:27:57,415 --> 04:27:59,959
Once the bucket
gets hot enough, Detective...

3050
04:28:00,042 --> 04:28:02,753
the rat is gonna want out.

3051
04:28:04,547 --> 04:28:07,383
And the only direction it can go,
is south.

3052
04:28:11,554 --> 04:28:12,930
Hold that.

3053
04:28:13,431 --> 04:28:14,974
Get it off me!

3054
04:28:15,099 --> 04:28:16,183
I'll forget it-

3055
04:28:16,267 --> 04:28:17,560
Shut up.

3056
04:28:18,436 --> 04:28:23,107
Did you know that your average rat
can chew through a steel drainpipe?

3057
04:28:24,442 --> 04:28:27,695
You have nothing to worry about
when he's screaming.

3058
04:28:27,778 --> 04:28:30,531
It's when he goes quiet
that he goes to work.

3059
04:28:30,615 --> 04:28:32,283
Stop it!

3060
04:28:33,618 --> 04:28:36,996
You can't be this stupid!
Stop it now!

3061
04:28:37,079 --> 04:28:40,583
You're in charge of the units
that are watching my properties.

3062
04:28:41,167 --> 04:28:43,669
What I want is a 15-minute window...

3063
04:28:43,753 --> 04:28:46,464
where everybody,
and I mean everybody, disappears.

3064
04:28:46,547 --> 04:28:49,050
- I can't do it!
- You can't?

3065
04:28:51,135 --> 04:28:52,428
Stop it.

3066
04:28:52,511 --> 04:28:54,805
Okay. Monica, come here.

3067
04:28:55,139 --> 04:28:56,390
Help!

3068
04:28:57,433 --> 04:28:58,893
Shut him up.

3069
04:29:00,102 --> 04:29:01,771
Help!

3070
04:29:07,943 --> 04:29:09,403
It's biting me!

3071
04:29:11,113 --> 04:29:12,281
What?

3072
04:29:14,283 --> 04:29:16,285
Got something you want to say?

3073
04:29:17,912 --> 04:29:19,955
It bit me. Jesus.

3074
04:29:21,082 --> 04:29:23,376
- I'll do it!
- Do what? Say it.

3075
04:29:23,459 --> 04:29:26,212
I'll do it.
I'll give you your window.

3076
04:29:27,421 --> 04:29:29,090
Just get it off me.

3077
04:29:29,173 --> 04:29:30,591
Get it off!

3078
04:29:32,676 --> 04:29:34,345
You betray me...

3079
04:29:35,054 --> 04:29:36,847
and my rat here...

3080
04:29:37,723 --> 04:29:40,309
is gonna visit your wife, Lynn...

3081
04:29:40,726 --> 04:29:43,354
your son, Clay,
and your daughter, Lexi.

3082
04:29:43,437 --> 04:29:46,023
Do you hear me?
Do you understand me?

3083
04:29:46,357 --> 04:29:48,150
- Hear me?
- Get it off.

3084
04:29:48,234 --> 04:29:51,237
I'll burn your fucking eyes out!
I'll burn them out.

3085
04:29:54,740 --> 04:29:56,659
Now, you can go.

3086
04:29:57,576 --> 04:30:00,246
Get rid of him. Let's go.
Get it off.

3087
04:30:09,755 --> 04:30:11,590
You boys enjoy the show?

3088
04:30:12,216 --> 04:30:15,845
Fifteen minutes, and then every cop
in Florida's gonna be on you.

3089
04:30:15,928 --> 04:30:19,890
Be at Versailles Café at 6:00 a.m.,
day after tomorrow, ready to drive.

3090
04:30:19,974 --> 04:30:21,934
- You understand?
- Yeah.

3091
04:30:22,059 --> 04:30:24,019
Don't play games with me...

3092
04:30:24,562 --> 04:30:26,981
or you'll be next. All right?

3093
04:30:27,606 --> 04:30:30,526
Help yourself to a little champagne.
Let's go.

3094
04:30:33,612 --> 04:30:35,447
That was a damn rat.

3095
04:30:45,124 --> 04:30:49,628
You ever touch another man again,
and I'll kill you.

3096
04:30:49,837 --> 04:30:51,297
You hear me?

3097
04:30:52,923 --> 04:30:54,967
Look at me. You hear me?

3098
04:31:02,266 --> 04:31:04,894
She was into it.
What's that about?

3099
04:31:05,477 --> 04:31:08,063
You seen the way she grabbed
the dude's head.

3100
04:31:08,147 --> 04:31:12,651
She had to. He was testing her.
Her ass is on the line, like ours.

3101
04:31:13,527 --> 04:31:15,613
You're feeling this girl
way too much.

3102
04:31:15,696 --> 04:31:19,366
She's like that trailer rat
from back in the day, Tanya.

3103
04:31:19,450 --> 04:31:22,578
Tanya? Man, you went out with her
after I did.

3104
04:31:23,829 --> 04:31:25,873
I couldn't let it go to waste.

3105
04:31:25,956 --> 04:31:27,333
I got you.

3106
04:31:27,916 --> 04:31:29,418
Is that right?

3107
04:31:29,501 --> 04:31:32,421
We go race for cash,
but when I step on the gas...

3108
04:31:32,504 --> 04:31:35,674
my nitrous go blast,
leave your ass in the past.

3109
04:31:35,758 --> 04:31:38,010
Tej, you about
to lose your garage.

3110
04:31:38,093 --> 04:31:39,511
Whatever, man.

3111
04:31:39,595 --> 04:31:42,264
I'm a low-budget mechanic,
but I overcharge.

3112
04:31:42,348 --> 04:31:45,142
Pay me! Let's go, man.

3113
04:31:45,434 --> 04:31:47,102
Pay me my money.

3114
04:31:47,186 --> 04:31:50,314
I'm glad you're happy.
This is my garage.

3115
04:31:50,939 --> 04:31:53,317
Royal flush. Give me this, man.

3116
04:31:53,776 --> 04:31:55,235
Talk to him.

3117
04:31:55,402 --> 04:31:59,948
Put that money back on the table.
You know it's mine next hand.

3118
04:32:00,032 --> 04:32:04,078
Jimmy, how're you gonna pay me back
if you keep losing to Tej like that?

3119
04:32:04,328 --> 04:32:07,331
I'm going to crash, Tej.
I'll catch you tomorrow.

3120
04:32:23,722 --> 04:32:25,057
What are you doing here?

3121
04:32:25,140 --> 04:32:29,019
They're gonna kill you. I heard him
telling Enrique and Roberto.

3122
04:32:29,103 --> 04:32:32,231
Once you finish the run, they're
putting a bullet in your head.

3123
04:32:32,564 --> 04:32:34,400
You sure you heard him right?

3124
04:32:34,650 --> 04:32:35,692
I'm sure.

3125
04:32:43,283 --> 04:32:45,369
Verone's boys is outside...

3126
04:32:45,911 --> 04:32:49,832
I see what they're looking for.
Your little girlfriend here.

3127
04:32:54,169 --> 04:32:57,589
- They don't know. I snuck out.
- What are they doing here then?

3128
04:32:57,673 --> 04:32:59,675
I don't know.
Maybe they're guessing.

3129
04:33:00,134 --> 04:33:02,636
Go stall them for,
like, two minutes.

3130
04:33:02,719 --> 04:33:04,680
Check her, homey.

3131
04:33:09,852 --> 04:33:12,187
Found what you're
looking for?

3132
04:33:16,567 --> 04:33:19,194
Hey, buddy. Hi, guys. How you doing?

3133
04:33:21,071 --> 04:33:23,198
Y'all still mad about y'all car?

3134
04:33:23,282 --> 04:33:26,201
Don't even trip.
Come on, man, can't you take a joke?

3135
04:33:27,077 --> 04:33:30,164
This isn't about being a good cop
or doing your job.

3136
04:33:30,247 --> 04:33:32,291
They're gonna kill you.
You gotta pull out.

3137
04:33:32,374 --> 04:33:34,626
Verone pay you
to keep a straight face like that?

3138
04:33:34,710 --> 04:33:38,714
'Cause if I was making money,
I'd remove that mole off my nose.

3139
04:33:38,797 --> 04:33:40,799
- Okay?
- Yeah.

3140
04:33:40,883 --> 04:33:43,051
How much he pay y'all anyway?

3141
04:33:43,135 --> 04:33:46,680
Every time I see y'all,
y'all got the silk shirts on...

3142
04:33:46,763 --> 04:33:49,016
jewelry, looking real Miami.

3143
04:33:49,516 --> 04:33:54,062
I caught you walking up in the club,
the hamburger meat all hanging out.

3144
04:33:55,981 --> 04:33:58,525
Don't make that run, Brian.

3145
04:33:59,359 --> 04:34:00,777
Be careful.

3146
04:34:14,499 --> 04:34:17,628
Where are you going?
You stay right here with us, buddy.

3147
04:34:26,553 --> 04:34:28,388
Don't even think about it.

3148
04:34:40,609 --> 04:34:43,528
Stay your ass off my homeboy's boat.

3149
04:34:50,410 --> 04:34:53,205
Put the gun down now!

3150
04:34:53,497 --> 04:34:55,207
You first, asshole!

3151
04:34:55,290 --> 04:34:57,125
I'll shoot the shit out of him!

3152
04:35:02,422 --> 04:35:07,135
Put down the gun!

3153
04:35:08,095 --> 04:35:09,721
Enough.

3154
04:35:10,097 --> 04:35:11,973
Shut up.

3155
04:35:13,684 --> 04:35:15,477
It's over. Come on.

3156
04:35:15,977 --> 04:35:17,521
It's over. Let's go.

3157
04:35:18,522 --> 04:35:20,816
It's our gun. Come on, let's go.

3158
04:35:26,113 --> 04:35:28,824
I'm glad to see you boys
are getting along so well...

3159
04:35:28,907 --> 04:35:33,662
because tomorrow, Roberto and
Enrique'll be riding along with you.

3160
04:35:34,121 --> 04:35:36,206
Just so we don't have any problems.

3161
04:35:36,289 --> 04:35:38,208
I'll see you guys in a bit.

3162
04:35:42,087 --> 04:35:44,214
What the hell
was she doing in there?

3163
04:35:54,975 --> 04:35:57,227
Where'd you go this morning?

3164
04:35:57,352 --> 04:35:59,896
I went to breakfast
with some friends.

3165
04:36:05,610 --> 04:36:07,112
With friends?

3166
04:36:09,072 --> 04:36:11,199
I do have friends, Carter.

3167
04:36:17,873 --> 04:36:19,040
Okay.

3168
04:36:21,042 --> 04:36:22,586
I'll see you later.

3169
04:36:31,928 --> 04:36:33,346
Nice shirt, Bilkins.

3170
04:36:33,430 --> 04:36:35,098
It's my day off.

3171
04:36:37,184 --> 04:36:38,894
Well, anyhow, this is the deal.

3172
04:36:39,436 --> 04:36:42,772
Last night, Verone threatened a cop
into giving us a window.

3173
04:36:42,856 --> 04:36:46,151
We're driving to an airstrip
in the Keys, off Nallwood Avenue.

3174
04:36:46,234 --> 04:36:48,862
Verone has a plane there
and he's taking off for good.

3175
04:36:48,945 --> 04:36:50,822
Wait a minute. How do you know this?

3176
04:36:51,114 --> 04:36:52,365
Monica.

3177
04:36:52,782 --> 04:36:55,577
She's doing her job. She warned us.

3178
04:36:55,660 --> 04:36:57,120
She warned you about what?

3179
04:36:57,204 --> 04:36:59,664
Verone plans to kill us
after we give him the money.

3180
04:36:59,748 --> 04:37:03,126
Driving into an ambush
wasn't the deal. I'm calling it off.

3181
04:37:03,210 --> 04:37:06,546
Like hell you are.
This is a Customs case, Bilkins.

3182
04:37:06,630 --> 04:37:08,798
No one's calling this off
unless I do.

3183
04:37:08,882 --> 04:37:10,717
Look, this is real simple.

3184
04:37:11,259 --> 04:37:15,597
Make the run, get Verone and his
cash together, so I can move in.

3185
04:37:15,680 --> 04:37:18,892
You don't, I'll file enough charges
on you to make you disappear.

3186
04:37:18,975 --> 04:37:20,393
Take these.

3187
04:37:20,477 --> 04:37:23,897
We're gonna have GPS on you
so you don't get any cute ideas.

3188
04:37:23,980 --> 04:37:26,149
And to make sure
nothing happens to them, right?

3189
04:37:26,232 --> 04:37:27,692
Yeah, right.

3190
04:37:36,534 --> 04:37:38,286
That guy's a dick.

3191
04:37:41,331 --> 04:37:43,291
Let me get this right.

3192
04:37:43,667 --> 04:37:46,252
If we don't do this,
then we go to jail.

3193
04:37:46,628 --> 04:37:49,589
But if we do it,
then Verone's going to kill us.

3194
04:37:49,756 --> 04:37:52,842
- It's a hell of a deal, huh?
- Yeah.

3195
04:37:54,427 --> 04:37:55,887
Maybe it is.

3196
04:37:57,430 --> 04:38:01,768
This guy's got an ass full of loot
that he's ready to dump in our cars.

3197
04:38:02,102 --> 04:38:06,272
I can think of two reasons why
he doesn't need that money anymore.

3198
04:38:06,356 --> 04:38:07,732
Here we go.

3199
04:38:07,816 --> 04:38:09,234
You and me.

3200
04:38:09,442 --> 04:38:11,069
Just like the old days.

3201
04:38:11,152 --> 04:38:15,448
- What do you think?
- They messed with the wrong guys.

3202
04:38:18,576 --> 04:38:20,787
- Tej, what's up, bro?
- What's up?

3203
04:38:20,870 --> 04:38:22,497
How quickly can you organize?

3204
04:38:22,580 --> 04:38:25,375
Look, if y'all really want
to carry out this plan...

3205
04:38:25,458 --> 04:38:28,920
this is the best place to do it.
What do y'all think?

3206
04:38:29,003 --> 04:38:31,589
I think it's perfect.
So, what do they store here?

3207
04:38:37,595 --> 04:38:38,930
This thing is clean.

3208
04:38:39,013 --> 04:38:40,223
Distributor cap.

3209
04:38:54,904 --> 04:38:59,742
Jimmy, do we have any half-empty
bottles of nitrous lying around?

3210
04:38:59,826 --> 04:39:01,911
Sure, but I've already
loaded you for spray.

3211
04:39:01,995 --> 04:39:04,664
I'm thinking we may need it
for something else...

3212
04:39:04,747 --> 04:39:07,542
'cause our cars may get
a little crowded, you know?

3213
04:39:15,884 --> 04:39:18,428
When did you start eating so much?

3214
04:39:19,429 --> 04:39:21,306
I was in jail, bruh.

3215
04:39:21,639 --> 04:39:24,476
I know how shitty the grub is
on the inside.

3216
04:39:25,602 --> 04:39:28,229
The way things are shaping up
out here right now...

3217
04:39:28,313 --> 04:39:31,524
it'll be a matter of time
before I'm back in there, or dead.

3218
04:39:33,026 --> 04:39:36,029
So I'm trying to eat all I can
while I can.

3219
04:39:37,655 --> 04:39:40,950
Plus, the doctor tells me
I got a high metabolism.

3220
04:39:45,663 --> 04:39:47,665
You remember us growing up?

3221
04:39:48,249 --> 04:39:50,543
Playing football in the dirt?

3222
04:39:51,419 --> 04:39:54,839
Getting into trouble.
All the stupid things we did?

3223
04:39:56,049 --> 04:39:59,052
When you got busted,
whether I was a cop or not...

3224
04:39:59,135 --> 04:40:01,387
if there was anything
I could have done...

3225
04:40:02,263 --> 04:40:04,140
I would have done it.

3226
04:40:04,724 --> 04:40:06,893
I just want you to know that.

3227
04:40:07,518 --> 04:40:10,021
Is that why
you let that dude go in L.A.?

3228
04:40:12,273 --> 04:40:14,984
Yeah, I think
that had a lot to do with it.

3229
04:40:17,237 --> 04:40:19,072
When I got busted...

3230
04:40:19,656 --> 04:40:20,823
it wasn't your fault.

3231
04:40:22,033 --> 04:40:25,328
It was all on me, Mr. Roman Pearce.

3232
04:40:25,912 --> 04:40:27,956
Wild and out. Crazy man.

3233
04:40:28,998 --> 04:40:31,167
No one could tell me nothing.

3234
04:40:31,251 --> 04:40:32,710
Riding solo.

3235
04:40:33,336 --> 04:40:34,796
Yeah, well, not anymore.

3236
04:40:40,551 --> 04:40:42,261
Not anymore, bro.

3237
04:41:07,620 --> 04:41:09,914
I've got Verone's Navigator
leaving the residence.

3238
04:41:09,998 --> 04:41:11,165
Copy.

3239
04:41:11,874 --> 04:41:14,377
Sir, we've got Verone on the move
to the airstrip.

3240
04:41:14,460 --> 04:41:17,255
Let's get a bird in the air.
Tell him to keep his distance.

3241
04:41:19,882 --> 04:41:21,342
- Ready.
- Thanks.

3242
04:41:23,052 --> 04:41:25,096
- You're all set.
- Thanks.

3243
04:41:25,680 --> 04:41:28,349
- All set?
- Yeah. Let's do it.

3244
04:41:31,436 --> 04:41:32,687
Report.

3245
04:41:34,939 --> 04:41:37,066
What's going on
out there?

3246
04:41:38,693 --> 04:41:39,902
Team One, checking in.

3247
04:41:39,986 --> 04:41:42,697
- Team Two, checking in.
- Team Three, checking in.

3248
04:41:42,780 --> 04:41:44,949
Team Four,
all clear here, too.

3249
04:41:45,491 --> 04:41:47,410
Team Five, checking in.

3250
04:41:48,202 --> 04:41:50,037
Team Six, all clear.

3251
04:41:55,460 --> 04:41:58,171
- Here we go.
- Yeah, so you know what to do.

3252
04:41:58,254 --> 04:42:00,298
Stay cool. Keep focused.

3253
04:42:00,673 --> 04:42:03,259
Remember the airstrip's
off Nallwood Avenue.

3254
04:42:03,342 --> 04:42:05,595
It's the third exit
after the bridge.

3255
04:42:07,263 --> 04:42:08,514
Got it.

3256
04:42:08,639 --> 04:42:10,558
You ready for this?

3257
04:42:10,641 --> 04:42:14,270
Come on, man.
Guns, murderers, and crooked cops?

3258
04:42:14,437 --> 04:42:16,189
I was made for this, bruh!

3259
04:42:51,849 --> 04:42:53,142
Come on.

3260
04:43:16,749 --> 04:43:19,752
I got activity
at Verone's trailer property.

3261
04:43:20,169 --> 04:43:23,047
Do not move an inch
until I tell you to!

3262
04:43:48,030 --> 04:43:49,323
Load up.

3263
04:43:52,159 --> 04:43:53,411
All units...

3264
04:43:53,494 --> 04:43:56,539
move on the trailer property.
Right now! Move!

3265
04:44:03,462 --> 04:44:06,382
Shit. Local P.D.
is moving in on our guys.

3266
04:44:06,799 --> 04:44:09,301
- Three bags in one car?
- Guess so.

3267
04:44:22,690 --> 04:44:24,025
The cops.

3268
04:44:28,320 --> 04:44:29,739
I am not going back to jail.

3269
04:44:29,822 --> 04:44:31,991
Where are you going, man? Let's go!

3270
04:44:33,367 --> 04:44:35,077
What is he doing?

3271
04:44:56,515 --> 04:44:59,977
Now let's get the chopper over them.
I want eyes right on top.

3272
04:45:00,060 --> 04:45:01,145
You got it.

3273
04:45:01,228 --> 04:45:02,271
Lima 2-5...

3274
04:45:02,354 --> 04:45:03,898
follow GPS.

3275
04:45:12,239 --> 04:45:14,575
Do you know what you're doing?

3276
04:45:17,661 --> 04:45:20,080
Stay with me, Rome. Come on, man.

3277
04:45:28,380 --> 04:45:30,883
I've got them heading south
on I-95.

3278
04:45:30,966 --> 04:45:33,052
Bring in the aerial ESDs.

3279
04:45:42,686 --> 04:45:43,854
Oh, shit!

3280
04:45:47,191 --> 04:45:50,069
- They're catching up, man!
- Shut up, man!

3281
04:46:01,830 --> 04:46:03,624
Nice driving, Rome.

3282
04:46:03,832 --> 04:46:05,543
I got you, Brian.

3283
04:46:10,673 --> 04:46:12,174
Check it out!

3284
04:46:24,728 --> 04:46:26,272
What was that?

3285
04:46:36,907 --> 04:46:38,075
Oh, shit!

3286
04:46:51,839 --> 04:46:54,508
- Come on, man. Take the wheel.
- No. I can't drive.

3287
04:46:54,591 --> 04:46:57,886
Just hold the wheel!
Put your hands on it! Hold steady!

3288
04:47:01,640 --> 04:47:03,434
What are you doing, man?

3289
04:47:58,155 --> 04:47:59,490
Yeah, man!

3290
04:48:15,506 --> 04:48:16,673
Hold.

3291
04:48:19,218 --> 04:48:21,678
Bilkins, the bird's in place.

3292
04:48:25,516 --> 04:48:26,683
Yeah.

3293
04:48:28,477 --> 04:48:29,812
We've got Verone's Navigator.

3294
04:48:29,895 --> 04:48:32,815
All right. Money's in transit.
Sit tight.

3295
04:49:17,359 --> 04:49:19,486
You're a good driver, man.

3296
04:49:19,570 --> 04:49:21,572
Thanks, bro.

3297
04:49:26,451 --> 04:49:30,372
We've got the area blocked ahead.
They've got nowhere to go.

3298
04:49:39,464 --> 04:49:41,008
What was that?

3299
04:49:41,800 --> 04:49:43,010
I've got a visual.

3300
04:49:43,677 --> 04:49:45,804
Video should be coming through.

3301
04:49:45,887 --> 04:49:47,764
I got it. Looks good.

3302
04:49:49,391 --> 04:49:51,268
Where are they going?

3303
04:49:59,568 --> 04:50:00,736
Shit.

3304
04:50:06,116 --> 04:50:09,411
All right, Miami's finest,
let's see what you got.

3305
04:50:10,120 --> 04:50:12,289
Come on. Stay with me, boys.

3306
04:50:18,295 --> 04:50:20,630
Hey, man, everyone's here.
Time for the show.

3307
04:50:20,714 --> 04:50:22,632
Let's give it to them.

3308
04:50:26,887 --> 04:50:29,765
All right, let the party begin.
Let's go!

3309
04:50:48,575 --> 04:50:52,037
This is unit 25-99.
We have the suspects surrounded.

3310
04:51:43,839 --> 04:51:45,215
Holy shit!

3311
04:51:51,221 --> 04:51:53,723
It's a scramble, baby! A big one!

3312
04:51:59,688 --> 04:52:01,523
Yeah! Let's do this!

3313
04:52:09,531 --> 04:52:11,116
Check this out.

3314
04:52:19,416 --> 04:52:21,167
We're not tracking them
on the video.

3315
04:52:21,251 --> 04:52:23,712
We must have lost them
in the scramble.

3316
04:52:23,795 --> 04:52:25,463
Yo, let's break.

3317
04:52:26,923 --> 04:52:28,091
Yeah!

3318
04:53:11,259 --> 04:53:13,595
All right, we got them going west
on Beach.

3319
04:53:13,678 --> 04:53:15,805
Roger that! I've got them!

3320
04:53:27,901 --> 04:53:31,237
Customs has a fix on two cars
going west on Beach.

3321
04:53:31,654 --> 04:53:33,490
Roger. Follow those cars.

3322
04:53:33,573 --> 04:53:34,991
Roger that.

3323
04:53:57,097 --> 04:53:58,264
Shit.

3324
04:53:59,307 --> 04:54:01,017
They're cornered.

3325
04:54:05,271 --> 04:54:07,982
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

3326
04:54:08,066 --> 04:54:09,400
Hands up!

3327
04:54:09,943 --> 04:54:13,863
I know my tags are out of date,
but damn.

3328
04:54:22,038 --> 04:54:23,581
What the hell?

3329
04:54:24,916 --> 04:54:26,501
Where are they?

3330
04:54:48,606 --> 04:54:50,108
How about them apples, man?

3331
04:54:50,191 --> 04:54:53,278
Yeah! That's some driving
for your ass, baby!

3332
04:54:54,696 --> 04:54:55,780
Good job, man.

3333
04:54:55,864 --> 04:54:57,866
- What are you talking about?
- Whatever.

3334
04:54:57,949 --> 04:54:59,909
You're supposed to be
a stone-faced killer!

3335
04:54:59,993 --> 04:55:01,828
You were grabbing your seat belt!

3336
04:55:01,911 --> 04:55:05,415
Hey, Tej, thanks a lot, bro.
You're clutch. I owe you big time.

3337
04:55:05,498 --> 04:55:09,168
Yeah, Brian, you really do owe me.
You really do...

3338
04:55:10,044 --> 04:55:11,087
Us.

3339
04:55:11,296 --> 04:55:13,715
Suki says you owe us, all right?

3340
04:55:16,092 --> 04:55:18,678
- Rome, you there? Come in.
- What's up, man?

3341
04:55:18,761 --> 04:55:20,930
Looks like we got
just one trick left.

3342
04:55:21,014 --> 04:55:23,725
My pleasure, buddy!
Let's do it, baby!

3343
04:55:24,684 --> 04:55:26,895
Maybe we should grab Verone
while we still can.

3344
04:55:26,978 --> 04:55:28,438
No! Not yet!

3345
04:55:30,565 --> 04:55:31,733
What?

3346
04:55:31,816 --> 04:55:32,942
You lost them?

3347
04:55:33,026 --> 04:55:34,193
Shit!

3348
04:55:34,402 --> 04:55:35,862
Those little pricks are running!

3349
04:55:35,945 --> 04:55:37,697
It's your call.
What do you want to do?

3350
04:55:37,780 --> 04:55:40,325
We're gonna take him down.
He is not leaving here.

3351
04:55:40,950 --> 04:55:42,702
Enjoying the ride?

3352
04:55:43,703 --> 04:55:45,371
It's a fast car, huh?

3353
04:55:47,165 --> 04:55:49,334
It's a classic. Old school.

3354
04:55:49,792 --> 04:55:51,461
American muscle.

3355
04:55:53,546 --> 04:55:57,133
This car can do all kinds of things.
Want to see?

3356
04:55:59,052 --> 04:56:01,179
Check this out right here, homey.

3357
04:56:01,262 --> 04:56:03,556
Hey, what are you doing,
man?

3358
04:56:13,107 --> 04:56:14,609
Ejecto seato!

3359
04:56:15,276 --> 04:56:17,612
It worked! I love this button!

3360
04:56:19,989 --> 04:56:21,741
Stay on your toes!

3361
04:56:22,867 --> 04:56:26,329
Mr. O'Conner, it worked!
Blow and go. I'm all clear.

3362
04:56:26,579 --> 04:56:29,123
Meet me at the point!
Hurry up! It's on!

3363
04:56:29,207 --> 04:56:30,291
All right. 10-4, man.

3364
04:56:30,375 --> 04:56:32,210
Are you ready? Let's go!

3365
04:56:42,595 --> 04:56:45,306
Let me see your hands!

3366
04:56:45,390 --> 04:56:46,641
Freeze!

3367
04:56:47,433 --> 04:56:48,643
Clear!

3368
04:56:55,024 --> 04:56:58,861
- It's not Verone and Fuentes.
- What do you mean?

3369
04:56:59,112 --> 04:57:00,071
Then where the hell are they?

3370
04:57:07,662 --> 04:57:09,705
Get off at Tarpon Point.

3371
04:57:10,456 --> 04:57:13,793
Tarpon Point?
There's no airstrip at Tarpon Point.

3372
04:57:14,627 --> 04:57:17,255
Who said anything about an airstrip?

3373
04:57:30,434 --> 04:57:31,644
Brian?

3374
04:57:32,353 --> 04:57:34,188
What's the hold-up, bro?

3375
04:57:34,397 --> 04:57:36,899
Yo. There's a new plan.
What the hell?

3376
04:57:36,983 --> 04:57:40,403
We meet him at Tarpon Point exit,
not the airstrip.

3377
04:57:40,486 --> 04:57:43,906
- So, what are you saying?
- Like I said, there's a new plan.

3378
04:57:46,242 --> 04:57:47,451
Brian?

3379
04:57:47,994 --> 04:57:50,037
Brian? Hello, you there?

3380
04:57:52,123 --> 04:57:53,207
Damn!

3381
04:57:53,291 --> 04:57:54,750
What the hell is he doing?

3382
04:57:54,834 --> 04:57:56,502
The feds are in the wrong place.

3383
04:57:56,586 --> 04:57:58,754
Brian's woman is on her own
with Verone.

3384
04:57:58,838 --> 04:57:59,881
So...

3385
04:57:59,964 --> 04:58:01,883
So Brian's not coming!

3386
04:58:18,024 --> 04:58:20,067
- Let him out.
- Get out.

3387
04:58:27,700 --> 04:58:28,826
Pop the trunk.

3388
04:58:31,287 --> 04:58:32,622
Hurry up.

3389
04:58:48,137 --> 04:58:49,388
Where's the rest?

3390
04:58:49,472 --> 04:58:51,390
- The other car.
- Another car?

3391
04:58:51,849 --> 04:58:54,268
- Where's the other car?
- On its way.

3392
04:58:54,352 --> 04:58:56,062
- On the way?
- Yeah.

3393
04:58:57,271 --> 04:58:58,522
Here's your money.

3394
04:58:58,606 --> 04:59:01,943
So you know nothing about the agents
that stormed my jet?

3395
04:59:08,824 --> 04:59:12,328
The funny thing is, I only told
one person about the airstrip.

3396
04:59:26,717 --> 04:59:30,388
Customs agents sure
are getting pretty, aren't they?

3397
04:59:34,684 --> 04:59:36,435
Put her on the boat.

3398
04:59:38,521 --> 04:59:40,690
- Let's go.
- Get on the boat.

3399
04:59:55,162 --> 04:59:57,289
Hide the cars and get rid of him.

3400
04:59:57,373 --> 04:59:58,874
Back in the car.

3401
05:00:26,569 --> 05:00:27,945
End of the road.

3402
05:00:30,406 --> 05:00:31,824
You know, I like you.

3403
05:00:31,907 --> 05:00:34,869
But I still got to kill you.
It's my job.

3404
05:00:38,456 --> 05:00:39,790
What's that?

3405
05:00:41,250 --> 05:00:42,835
It's Barstow, baby!

3406
05:00:43,210 --> 05:00:44,920
It's about to get ugly!

3407
05:00:52,887 --> 05:00:54,263
Let's go.

3408
05:01:30,132 --> 05:01:31,383
Come on.

3409
05:01:57,910 --> 05:01:59,328
You had me.

3410
05:02:01,497 --> 05:02:02,957
You slipped.

3411
05:02:04,291 --> 05:02:07,044
Eleven and a half months,
and you slipped once.

3412
05:02:08,420 --> 05:02:10,214
Put her downstairs.

3413
05:02:16,345 --> 05:02:18,013
See you in a second.

3414
05:02:23,811 --> 05:02:25,145
I thought you was dead.

3415
05:02:25,229 --> 05:02:27,398
Me, too. Thanks for saving my ass.

3416
05:02:27,481 --> 05:02:28,774
What are you doing?

3417
05:02:28,857 --> 05:02:32,194
If Verone sees a helicopter
or Customs boat, she's dead!

3418
05:02:32,277 --> 05:02:33,278
Boat.

3419
05:02:33,612 --> 05:02:35,197
Car. Boat.

3420
05:02:35,614 --> 05:02:38,117
You're not gonna do
what I think you're gonna do?

3421
05:02:38,200 --> 05:02:41,203
- Yeah, I think so. You got my back?
- Yeah.

3422
05:02:41,286 --> 05:02:42,663
All right, put on the seat belt.

3423
05:02:42,746 --> 05:02:44,540
Show him some Dukes of Hazzard shit!

3424
05:02:44,623 --> 05:02:47,376
We're gonna do this big!
Hold on, Rome!

3425
05:02:53,882 --> 05:02:55,551
Brian, you're crazy, man!

3426
05:02:55,634 --> 05:02:57,386
What the hell are you doing?

3427
05:03:23,245 --> 05:03:24,997
I think I broke my arm.

3428
05:03:37,885 --> 05:03:39,344
Get the gun.

3429
05:04:00,282 --> 05:04:01,867
It's over, Carter.

3430
05:04:08,916 --> 05:04:10,167
You okay?

3431
05:04:10,334 --> 05:04:11,501
Yeah!

3432
05:04:12,794 --> 05:04:13,879
I'm great.

3433
05:04:20,177 --> 05:04:21,845
We got him, man.

3434
05:04:22,763 --> 05:04:25,349
We got him. Let's get out of here.

3435
05:04:45,452 --> 05:04:46,870
Go, go.

3436
05:04:56,129 --> 05:04:57,714
That ought to do it.

3437
05:04:58,382 --> 05:05:01,969
So, there were three bags total?
The three from the boat?

3438
05:05:02,970 --> 05:05:04,805
So we're good, right?

3439
05:05:05,180 --> 05:05:06,515
Our records are clean?

3440
05:05:06,598 --> 05:05:08,266
You held up your end.

3441
05:05:08,850 --> 05:05:10,519
Your records are clean.

3442
05:05:28,662 --> 05:05:30,998
So maybe there were six bags.

3443
05:05:31,957 --> 05:05:33,959
I guess we can call it even.

3444
05:05:34,209 --> 05:05:35,544
Agent Dunn?

3445
05:05:39,840 --> 05:05:41,758
We found some more evidence.

3446
05:05:44,177 --> 05:05:45,846
Let's take it inside.

3447
05:05:49,850 --> 05:05:52,102
Don't drop the soap, big homey.

3448
05:05:54,438 --> 05:05:57,858
I hope you know when he gets out,
he's going to kill your ass.

3449
05:05:59,192 --> 05:06:01,027
He ain't getting out.

3450
05:06:02,654 --> 05:06:04,072
I'll see you soon.

3451
05:06:04,614 --> 05:06:07,617
- You think he's going to get out?
- He'll be out.

3452
05:06:08,827 --> 05:06:11,204
Not for real.
You think he's getting out?

3453
05:06:11,872 --> 05:06:14,374
We took care of your decoys.
They're free and clear.

3454
05:06:14,458 --> 05:06:16,752
There's a sedan
out on the road for you.

3455
05:06:16,835 --> 05:06:19,004
Try to bring it back in one piece.

3456
05:06:21,089 --> 05:06:23,592
Thanks a lot, Bilkins.
You're all right.

3457
05:06:24,593 --> 05:06:26,303
Thanks for looking out.

3458
05:06:28,764 --> 05:06:30,640
Do you trust me now?

3459
05:06:30,766 --> 05:06:32,267
You're all right.

3460
05:06:36,730 --> 05:06:37,898
Sorry.

3461
05:06:39,274 --> 05:06:41,193
Nice working with you, O'Conner.

3462
05:06:41,318 --> 05:06:42,652
Same here.

3463
05:06:54,915 --> 05:06:59,002
I might have to stay here in Miami,
and keep you out of trouble, bruh.

3464
05:07:01,796 --> 05:07:03,632
You know what I'm talking about.

3465
05:07:03,715 --> 05:07:05,884
You're going to kick it
in Miami?

3466
05:07:06,259 --> 05:07:09,304
I love Miami.
Miami is off the hook!

3467
05:07:11,473 --> 05:07:13,517
Open a garage together.

3468
05:07:14,309 --> 05:07:17,145
A garage?
How are we going to do that?

3469
05:07:22,025 --> 05:07:24,110
Pockets ain't empty, cuz.

3470
05:07:28,198 --> 05:07:30,450
And we ain't hungry
no more, either.

3471
05:10:40,000 --> 05:10:41,000
Han!

3472
05:10:42,505 --> 05:10:44,985
Hello man.
Welcome to the D.R.

3473
05:10:45,642 --> 05:10:47,153
Put your suitcase in back here.

3474
05:12:24,884 --> 05:12:25,969
'Sup Boss!

3475
05:12:28,374 --> 05:12:29,420
I bring you something.

3476
05:12:49,090 --> 05:12:51,764
Can you explain to me
who is the Chinese guy?

3477
05:12:52,207 --> 05:12:54,063
Looks like you have been really
moving up in the world.

3478
05:12:56,133 --> 05:12:57,286
Who's this guy?

3479
05:13:07,711 --> 05:13:09,911
Santo, Han.
Han, Santo.

3480
05:13:13,194 --> 05:13:16,041
- You look like shit.
- That is a lot coming from you.

3481
05:13:17,278 --> 05:13:19,056
How come we can't stay in a hotel, huh?

3482
05:13:19,203 --> 05:13:21,176
Oh, complaining already!

3483
05:13:21,270 --> 05:13:23,969
I like air-conditioning, you know?
And room service.

3484
05:13:24,044 --> 05:13:25,865
- So, you guys love each other.
- With TV!

3485
05:13:54,550 --> 05:13:55,931
Dig in.

3486
05:14:12,922 --> 05:14:15,111
Welcome to our island, Han.

3487
05:14:15,494 --> 05:14:17,542
Island in paradise.

3488
05:14:23,934 --> 05:14:26,056
Tonight we go speak to Elvis.

3489
05:14:27,032 --> 05:14:28,780
See if we can fix this problem.

3490
05:14:28,851 --> 05:14:32,092
- First we pick up Leo.
- Leo?

3491
05:14:38,201 --> 05:14:41,619
So where are we actually picking
up this Leo friend of yours?

3492
05:14:43,390 --> 05:14:44,722
Prison.

3493
05:14:50,550 --> 05:14:55,859
Yo! My God!
Move! Move, man!

3494
05:15:00,796 --> 05:15:03,331
And that's why you're
always impressive man.

3495
05:15:10,528 --> 05:15:13,070
- Hey where you going?
- I'll be back, one second.

3496
05:15:14,446 --> 05:15:17,507
Or you could drive around the corner.
Park and come through the front.

3497
05:15:46,843 --> 05:15:47,843
Hey.

3498
05:15:48,043 --> 05:15:50,535
Wait, wait.
I ain't goin' out there like this.

3499
05:15:52,557 --> 05:15:53,718
Do you wanna wear my shirt?

3500
05:15:53,867 --> 05:15:55,612
No man. I got it covered, man.

3501
05:15:55,620 --> 05:15:57,242
Somebody's coming to bring my shit.

3502
05:15:57,758 --> 05:15:59,030
Don't worry.
I got it covered.

3503
05:16:00,216 --> 05:16:01,478
Who is this guy we're meeting?

3504
05:16:01,679 --> 05:16:05,259
Elvis.
He's a politician who gives a fuck about the people.

3505
05:16:34,750 --> 05:16:36,146
Beautiful.

3506
05:16:51,085 --> 05:16:54,532
Hey Han.
I bet this is a lot different than China.

3507
05:16:54,567 --> 05:16:57,579
- Never been.
- Or Japan, wherever you're from.

3508
05:16:59,230 --> 05:17:01,406
Like I said I never been
east of the Atlantic.

3509
05:17:01,407 --> 05:17:03,740
- He asked you where you're from.
- States.

3510
05:17:03,744 --> 05:17:06,695
- Is that where you met Dom?
- Nah, I met him in Mexico.

3511
05:17:06,811 --> 05:17:10,746
Used to hear about him in the racing scene.
But didn't start running with him until then.

3512
05:17:11,844 --> 05:17:14,510
And?  You guys are hungry?
Or you want me to get you guys a room?

3513
05:17:18,411 --> 05:17:22,207
That's cool.
So you've been running with him for a while?

3514
05:17:22,725 --> 05:17:27,366
Hey you know.  Here and there.
South America.  Tells me for all the fun stuff.

3515
05:17:27,391 --> 05:17:28,591
Wow.

3516
05:17:33,950 --> 05:17:36,924
Leo.
Have a seat.

3517
05:17:39,890 --> 05:17:42,500
- Hello.
- How you doing my friend?

3518
05:17:44,080 --> 05:17:45,963
Well this is the guy I was telling you about.

3519
05:17:46,478 --> 05:17:48,936
This meeting gonna be good.
For the island.

3520
05:17:48,971 --> 05:17:54,329
Well you know, my friend that I don't
like having unexpected guest.

3521
05:17:54,364 --> 05:17:56,182
I already got my crew here.

3522
05:18:03,843 --> 05:18:06,337
He knows how I like to do business.

3523
05:18:06,547 --> 05:18:08,296
Now, I tell you why.

3524
05:18:09,015 --> 05:18:13,098
When the merchandise gets here...
<i>Shut the fuck up!</i>

3525
05:18:19,495 --> 05:18:21,794
Like I was saying my friend.

3526
05:18:21,876 --> 05:18:25,421
I'll protect the merchandise
until it's out of the port.

3527
05:18:25,454 --> 05:18:26,620
Once it gets out...

3528
05:18:27,718 --> 05:18:31,452
If you wanna do something freaky
that's none of my business.

3529
05:18:32,692 --> 05:18:33,811
Okay.

3530
05:18:35,520 --> 05:18:37,213
Between the arrival...

3531
05:18:39,231 --> 05:18:40,771
and its destination...

3532
05:18:45,043 --> 05:18:48,139
there's a very slight window open.

3533
05:18:48,174 --> 05:18:49,663
Yeah, don't worry about that.

3534
05:18:54,500 --> 05:18:57,691
You know at the end of the day people
are gonna get what they need.

3535
05:19:00,321 --> 05:19:02,657
You can't move forward without fuel.

3536
05:19:04,763 --> 05:19:06,791
And no one wants to be left behind.

3537
05:19:08,999 --> 05:19:11,622
She can get it and give it to the people.

3538
05:19:15,647 --> 05:19:16,847
God bless.

3539
05:19:30,824 --> 05:19:32,458
Here baby, I got you a beer.

3540
05:19:46,828 --> 05:19:51,358
It ain't that hard to track you down.
All I gotta do is follow the odor of skanks.

3541
05:19:56,855 --> 05:19:57,999
Letty.

3542
05:20:00,928 --> 05:20:03,359
Life has a way of changing those plans.

3543
05:20:07,000 --> 05:20:08,611
Change of plans.

3544
05:20:10,927 --> 05:20:12,300
Where do we sleep?

3545
05:20:16,035 --> 05:20:17,730
Excuse me ladies.

3546
05:20:27,972 --> 05:20:30,540
That's right.
All the way from Mexico, sucker.

3547
05:21:22,974 --> 05:21:23,921
What?

3548
05:21:25,230 --> 05:21:26,392
Who is this?

3549
05:21:27,649 --> 05:21:30,982
Did I just hear you speaking Dominican?

3550
05:21:31,123 --> 05:21:33,844
It's been a while since I've
been back in the States.

3551
05:21:35,777 --> 05:21:38,107
- You know that.
- You're missed.

3552
05:21:40,346 --> 05:21:41,450
She's alright.

3553
05:21:48,047 --> 05:21:49,782
So what's going on?

3554
05:21:50,400 --> 05:21:52,623
I know you're not training
these boys for nothing.

3555
05:21:55,652 --> 05:21:58,740
Have I arrived just in time
for a new adventure?

3556
05:21:59,241 --> 05:22:02,409
Letty you always get here just
in time for something.

3557
05:22:03,632 --> 05:22:04,855
Come on, what is it?

3558
05:22:16,489 --> 05:22:19,210
I'll block you. You can't see.
What are you gonna do?

3559
05:22:19,329 --> 05:22:21,411
Oh my God, we're gonna crash.
Oh no!

3560
05:22:21,454 --> 05:22:22,906
What's gonna happen?

3561
05:23:01,611 --> 05:23:03,047
This place is crazy.

3562
05:23:06,476 --> 05:23:10,958
Rain one minute. Clouds the other.
Sunlight next.

3563
05:23:18,507 --> 05:23:19,717
Where you taking me?

3564
05:23:20,806 --> 05:23:23,944
Wait 'til you see.
Wait 'til you see.

3565
05:23:29,037 --> 05:23:30,386
Come here.

3566
05:24:31,043 --> 05:24:35,260
You feel that?
How could you be 3,000 miles away from that?

3567
05:24:35,314 --> 05:24:36,288
Can't.

3568
05:24:53,900 --> 05:24:55,061
Will this do?

3569
05:24:59,060 --> 05:25:01,267
We have eternity in this moment.

3570
05:25:02,180 --> 05:25:04,751
You will never be alone again.

3571
05:25:04,900 --> 05:25:07,426
I vow wherever you go, I go.

3572
05:25:07,580 --> 05:25:09,025
You ride, I ride.

3573
05:25:09,180 --> 05:25:10,944
You fight, I fight.

3574
05:25:11,100 --> 05:25:13,467
And if you ever die on me,
Dominic Toretto,

3575
05:25:13,980 --> 05:25:15,220
I'm gonna die with you.

3576
05:25:19,260 --> 05:25:21,467
<i>I love you, Letty.
I will always love you.</i>

3577
05:25:46,000 --> 05:25:48,251
All right,
we're good to go.

3578
05:25:48,377 --> 05:25:51,171
You got this? You bet your ass, bubba.

3579
05:25:51,714 --> 05:25:53,673
Let's make some money!

3580
05:25:59,764 --> 05:26:01,056
Everyone in position.

3581
05:26:03,351 --> 05:26:05,727
I thought we'd be
robbing banks by now,

3582
05:26:05,811 --> 05:26:08,188
not some gas truck
in the middle of nowhere.

3583
05:26:08,272 --> 05:26:10,941
Down here, gas is gold, bubba.

3584
05:26:19,659 --> 05:26:21,701
Kill the chatter!
Game time.

3585
05:26:21,786 --> 05:26:24,120
I wouldn't piss him off, guys.

3586
05:26:45,101 --> 05:26:47,018
Okay, guys, we're gonna have
to hit this hard and fast.

3587
05:26:47,103 --> 05:26:49,938
We got four K left
before the downgrade.

3588
05:27:11,085 --> 05:27:12,877
Locked and loaded!

3589
05:27:38,696 --> 05:27:40,780
This is all you, Han.

3590
05:27:46,203 --> 05:27:47,871
Liquid gold.

3591
05:27:55,171 --> 05:27:56,212
We're clear.

3592
05:27:56,297 --> 05:27:57,464
Okay, T, you're up.

3593
05:28:01,510 --> 05:28:04,554
Let's see if you can get it
under six tries this time, huh, T?

3594
05:28:07,767 --> 05:28:10,894
It's more like three. Come
on, Tego, keep it real.

3595
05:28:27,536 --> 05:28:31,081
Just one K left. We're running
out of road. Get in there, brother.

3596
05:28:31,165 --> 05:28:32,999
I got it, I got it.

3597
05:28:42,301 --> 05:28:43,468
Shit!

3598
05:28:48,933 --> 05:28:51,559
T, cut loose!
Unhitch, unhitch!

3599
05:29:37,898 --> 05:29:40,817
Spray that hitch!
I don't have a hammer!

3600
05:29:40,901 --> 05:29:42,402
Just do it!

3601
05:29:57,084 --> 05:29:58,418
Hold on! Hold on!

3602
05:29:58,502 --> 05:30:00,003
No shit!

3603
05:30:02,256 --> 05:30:04,382
Hold onto
something tight!

3604
05:30:28,157 --> 05:30:29,532
Letty!

3605
05:30:29,617 --> 05:30:31,868
Give me your hand!
I can't reach!

3606
05:30:31,952 --> 05:30:33,620
You got to jump!

3607
05:30:59,855 --> 05:31:01,022
Jump!

3608
05:31:02,524 --> 05:31:04,025
Letty, jump!

3609
05:31:08,656 --> 05:31:10,156
I've got you!

3610
05:31:43,315 --> 05:31:44,565
Dom...

3611
05:31:46,986 --> 05:31:48,111
Dom?

3612
05:31:52,199 --> 05:31:53,366
Dom!

3613
05:33:04,146 --> 05:33:05,730
How you doing?

3614
05:33:07,441 --> 05:33:08,983
Money, money!

3615
05:33:10,319 --> 05:33:11,486
Good.

3616
05:33:14,114 --> 05:33:16,032
Yo, why your stack
is bigger than mine always?

3617
05:33:16,116 --> 05:33:17,950
I'm supersized,
baby.

3618
05:33:27,795 --> 05:33:30,588
Cops just raided
our garage in Baracoa.

3619
05:33:31,382 --> 05:33:33,925
They were real
interested in you.

3620
05:33:34,510 --> 05:33:39,263
Heat's on and we just sent up a flare
that's gonna lead them right to us.

3621
05:33:39,348 --> 05:33:42,433
I say we move out first
thing in the morning.

3622
05:33:43,811 --> 05:33:45,853
Nah, it's me they want.

3623
05:33:46,480 --> 05:33:48,439
And if they catch me,

3624
05:33:48,524 --> 05:33:51,526
they're throwing big
numbers at anybody with me.

3625
05:33:54,696 --> 05:33:56,656
Han, we had a good run.

3626
05:33:58,659 --> 05:34:01,411
Time for you to go
do your own thing.

3627
05:34:05,332 --> 05:34:08,334
Heard they're doing
some crazy shit in Tokyo.

3628
05:34:14,633 --> 05:34:16,551
Have you seen Letty?

3629
05:34:29,106 --> 05:34:30,940
There she is.

3630
05:34:36,947 --> 05:34:39,657
I hear Rio is nice
this time of year.

3631
05:34:43,287 --> 05:34:45,580
The cops are
getting hungrier.

3632
05:34:45,664 --> 05:34:48,082
Then I guess we're doing our job.

3633
05:34:52,838 --> 05:34:54,797
I'm a walking target.

3634
05:34:55,382 --> 05:34:58,676
I don't want you around
when they catch up to me.

3635
05:35:00,429 --> 05:35:03,264
"Ride or die,"
remember?

3636
05:35:04,558 --> 05:35:07,393
Dom, how long have we been doing this?

3637
05:35:09,438 --> 05:35:13,232
And now all of a sudden, out
of nowhere, it's too dangerous?

3638
05:35:13,901 --> 05:35:15,401
Come on.

3639
05:35:20,407 --> 05:35:23,493
We'll figure it out.
We always do.

3640
05:38:50,575 --> 05:38:51,701
I don't know shit!
Give me a name!

3641
05:38:51,785 --> 05:38:53,869
I don't know shit, man!
Give me a name!

3642
05:38:53,954 --> 05:38:56,956
David Park! David
Park's the guy you want!

3643
05:38:57,541 --> 05:38:58,666
Please!

3644
05:39:06,341 --> 05:39:09,677
Thank God. Listen, he's in a mood
because yesterday was his cheat day,

3645
05:39:09,761 --> 05:39:11,721
and then today, some
genius brought in donuts.

3646
05:39:11,805 --> 05:39:13,013
Great.

3647
05:39:14,307 --> 05:39:15,933
Sorry I'm late.

3648
05:39:17,269 --> 05:39:21,564
Complaints keep rolling in after your
little downtown Olympics, O'Conner.

3649
05:39:21,648 --> 05:39:24,817
Tell me that reinstating
you wasn't a mistake.

3650
05:39:24,901 --> 05:39:28,070
I got a name. David Park. That's it?

3651
05:39:28,155 --> 05:39:30,614
That's all you got?
David Park?

3652
05:39:30,699 --> 05:39:33,576
I could throw a fortune cookie out this
window and hit 50 David Parks right now.

3653
05:39:33,660 --> 05:39:36,328
It's Korean, not Chinese. Whatever.

3654
05:39:36,997 --> 05:39:41,584
Park is a scout that recruits street
racers to be mules for the Braga cartel.

3655
05:39:41,668 --> 05:39:44,253
We find Park, and we bust the bad guys.

3656
05:39:46,900 --> 05:39:47,984
Yo.

3657
05:39:49,528 --> 05:39:51,279
Where's my money?

3658
05:41:08,400 --> 05:41:09,734
Dom.

3659
05:41:09,818 --> 05:41:12,487
Mia, I told you
not to call me here.

3660
05:41:12,988 --> 05:41:14,697
Dom, it's Letty.

3661
05:41:15,658 --> 05:41:17,492
She's been murdered.

3662
05:41:33,175 --> 05:41:37,637
We have gathered here
to pay our final respects to...

3663
05:41:37,721 --> 05:41:40,890
Let us reflect
on her journey...

3664
05:41:44,645 --> 05:41:49,357
"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall
not want. He makes me lie down... "

3665
05:42:09,211 --> 05:42:12,005
Facial recognition software
matched Toretto

3666
05:42:12,089 --> 05:42:13,923
about 10 minutes after
he crossed the border.

3667
05:42:16,885 --> 05:42:18,511
I don't get it.

3668
05:42:18,721 --> 05:42:20,596
I thought he'd show.

3669
05:43:15,319 --> 05:43:18,112
I told you not to come.
They're staking the place out.

3670
05:43:18,197 --> 05:43:20,656
If they find you...
They won't.

3671
05:43:23,494 --> 05:43:26,662
Come on.
Look at you.

3672
05:43:52,940 --> 05:43:55,399
Letty wouldn't
let them junk it.

3673
05:43:57,069 --> 05:43:59,570
Even though it is
a goddamn curse.

3674
05:44:02,366 --> 05:44:05,326
When she came back,
she was always in here,

3675
05:44:06,370 --> 05:44:08,871
working on it
day and night.

3676
05:44:14,503 --> 05:44:16,129
It was weird.

3677
05:44:17,756 --> 05:44:20,716
It was like she knew
you were coming back.

3678
05:44:22,761 --> 05:44:25,096
I want to see
the crash site.

3679
05:44:30,727 --> 05:44:34,188
I just got off the
phone with Deputy Director Lawson.

3680
05:44:34,898 --> 05:44:38,317
If we don't make serious inroads into
the Braga case in the next 72 hours,

3681
05:44:38,402 --> 05:44:40,653
they're gonna
shut us down.

3682
05:44:41,822 --> 05:44:44,365
I know I'm a newbie here,
but why the clock now?

3683
05:44:44,449 --> 05:44:46,242
Because it's been
two years,

3684
05:44:46,326 --> 05:44:48,828
and the last three agents we sent
to infiltrate his organization

3685
05:44:48,912 --> 05:44:51,289
came back in body bags.

3686
05:44:51,373 --> 05:44:55,960
He's moved more heroin across the
border than Escobar did in 10 years.

3687
05:44:56,044 --> 05:44:58,838
This guy is becoming one of
our biggest national threats,

3688
05:44:58,922 --> 05:45:01,007
and we don't even
have a picture of him.

3689
05:45:01,091 --> 05:45:04,594
We don't have prints!
Not even a goddamn DOB!

3690
05:45:07,639 --> 05:45:09,849
What's the status
on David Park?

3691
05:45:09,933 --> 05:45:12,143
Isn't he our ticket into
the Braga organization?

3692
05:45:12,227 --> 05:45:16,022
We're running the name through city and
county databases, sorting the possibilities.

3693
05:45:16,106 --> 05:45:18,024
We've got
over 500 already.

3694
05:45:18,108 --> 05:45:21,152
Park's insignificant. Sounds
like another jerk-off to me.

3695
05:45:21,236 --> 05:45:25,198
It's not. Without Park, Braga
wouldn't have drivers to move his shipments.

3696
05:45:25,282 --> 05:45:28,034
Cross-check traffic.
Illegal modifications.

3697
05:45:28,118 --> 05:45:32,455
Street racing. This guy will definitely
have a record. We'll find him.

3698
05:45:33,290 --> 05:45:34,749
We better.

3699
05:45:35,334 --> 05:45:37,084
What do you know?

3700
05:45:37,169 --> 05:45:40,838
Your boy Toretto's red Chevelle has
been spotted in his old neighborhood.

3701
05:45:40,923 --> 05:45:42,715
I'm going to
bring his ass in.

3702
05:45:42,799 --> 05:45:45,051
Not in your car
you're not.

3703
05:45:53,810 --> 05:45:55,686
It's straight ahead.

3704
05:48:01,438 --> 05:48:03,773
You found something
back there.

3705
05:48:08,695 --> 05:48:11,280
There were burn marks
on the ground.

3706
05:48:14,409 --> 05:48:17,620
The kind that could only
be caused by nitrometh.

3707
05:48:21,291 --> 05:48:24,627
There's only one guy in
all of L.A. that sells that.

3708
05:48:28,632 --> 05:48:31,842
Nothing you can do is
gonna bring her back, Dom.

3709
05:48:33,929 --> 05:48:36,222
If I were Letty,
I would ask you...

3710
05:48:36,306 --> 05:48:39,892
No, I would beg you,
please, let this go.

3711
05:48:41,103 --> 05:48:43,145
Before it's too late.

3712
05:48:47,651 --> 05:48:49,568
It's already too late.

3713
05:48:55,158 --> 05:48:56,534
I love you.

3714
05:50:03,518 --> 05:50:05,019
Miss Toretto.

3715
05:50:05,937 --> 05:50:08,272
I'm Michael Stasiak, FBl.

3716
05:50:08,815 --> 05:50:11,400
Let's you and I
have a little chat.

3717
05:50:32,923 --> 05:50:35,758
Hi. This is Forsythe
in Evidence.

3718
05:50:35,842 --> 05:50:39,470
I need Stasiak down here right
away to sign some greenies.

3719
05:50:39,554 --> 05:50:41,055
Thanks.

3720
05:50:41,139 --> 05:50:42,681
Hi.
Hey.

3721
05:50:42,766 --> 05:50:45,351
Okay, I narrowed it down
to 50 or so David Parks.

3722
05:50:45,435 --> 05:50:47,811
What I'd like you to do is run the
make and model on each one of them.

3723
05:50:47,896 --> 05:50:48,854
All right?
Okay. All right.

3724
05:50:48,939 --> 05:50:50,189
Thank you.

3725
05:51:00,825 --> 05:51:03,118
Hey, Tyler,
we got a transfer.

3726
05:51:05,288 --> 05:51:07,331
You want to
come with me?

3727
05:51:28,770 --> 05:51:30,020
Toretto.

3728
05:51:31,356 --> 05:51:32,898
When'd you get
back in town?

3729
05:51:32,983 --> 05:51:35,859
I'm looking for a car
you did an engine mod on.

3730
05:51:35,944 --> 05:51:40,447
Nitromethane tank. Ford
full-size. Continental tires.

3731
05:51:42,367 --> 05:51:45,703
Look, what are you doing,
coming in here like this, huh?

3732
05:51:46,246 --> 05:51:48,914
This ain't your scene
anymore, boss.

3733
05:51:48,999 --> 05:51:51,709
Don't ever put your hands
on me again, okay?

3734
05:51:51,793 --> 05:51:54,128
Say hi to your
sister for me.

3735
05:52:05,682 --> 05:52:09,018
A Korean kid brought it in. David Park.

3736
05:52:09,853 --> 05:52:12,187
It's a green Ford Torino.

3737
05:52:13,189 --> 05:52:15,524
Please don't
drop this on me!

3738
05:52:20,405 --> 05:52:22,114
I'm almost done.

3739
05:52:24,409 --> 05:52:27,870
Why don't you tell me why
you dragged me here, Brian?

3740
05:52:34,002 --> 05:52:37,880
You know they're going to
capture Dom. Maybe worse.

3741
05:52:39,591 --> 05:52:43,886
I don't want you getting tangled
up in this. So stay away from him.

3742
05:52:44,804 --> 05:52:48,182
That's what you have to
say to me after five years?

3743
05:52:49,559 --> 05:52:52,394
All of a sudden, you
care what happens to me.

3744
05:52:55,732 --> 05:52:58,150
What I did to you
was wrong.

3745
05:52:58,234 --> 05:53:02,529
I'm sorry. It was... It was the
hardest thing I've ever had to do.

3746
05:53:03,990 --> 05:53:05,908
I'm sorry, too, Brian.

3747
05:53:06,534 --> 05:53:11,288
I'm so sorry that you had to come
into my home and pretend to love me.

3748
05:53:11,373 --> 05:53:13,749
I'm so sorry that you
ripped my family apart.

3749
05:53:13,833 --> 05:53:16,752
I'm very sorry that
that was hard for you.

3750
05:53:20,465 --> 05:53:22,091
I lied to you.

3751
05:53:23,551 --> 05:53:26,095
I lied to Dom.
I lied to everybody.

3752
05:53:26,596 --> 05:53:29,848
That's what I do best. It's
why the Feds recruited me.

3753
05:53:31,518 --> 05:53:33,894
Maybe you're lying
to yourself.

3754
05:53:35,146 --> 05:53:38,857
Maybe you're not the good guy
pretending to be a bad guy.

3755
05:53:39,317 --> 05:53:42,695
Maybe you're the bad guy
pretending to be the good guy.

3756
05:53:42,779 --> 05:53:44,947
You ever think about that?

3757
05:53:46,574 --> 05:53:48,075
Every day.

3758
05:54:00,463 --> 05:54:02,297
I always wondered,

3759
05:54:04,509 --> 05:54:07,302
why did you let
my brother go that day?

3760
05:54:08,805 --> 05:54:10,305
I don't know.

3761
05:54:20,233 --> 05:54:21,650
Shit.

3762
05:54:24,779 --> 05:54:25,779
Brian!

3763
05:54:25,864 --> 05:54:28,866
I got the cross-checks on David Park
back and have a list of possibles.

3764
05:54:28,992 --> 05:54:31,410
What do you got? All right. A
45-year-old male in a '06 Scion

3765
05:54:31,494 --> 05:54:33,579
with three reckless driving tickets. No.

3766
05:54:33,663 --> 05:54:36,039
An '01 Chevy Tahoe.
No.

3767
05:54:36,124 --> 05:54:39,960
Two Mini Coopers, a '06
and a '07, a Toyota hybrid.

3768
05:54:40,044 --> 05:54:42,713
Hell no. A '98 Saturn, a '95 Sebring.

3769
05:54:42,797 --> 05:54:44,923
A '98 Nissan 240
with an illegal mod.

3770
05:54:45,008 --> 05:54:47,009
Wait. That's it.

3771
05:54:47,093 --> 05:54:49,595
What? The 240 with the illegal mod.

3772
05:54:49,721 --> 05:54:52,973
How do you know? 'Cause
that's something I'd drive.

3773
05:55:17,415 --> 05:55:18,874
Don't! Don't! Don't!

3774
05:55:30,512 --> 05:55:33,222
Green Torino,
running nitro.

3775
05:55:34,182 --> 05:55:35,849
Whose car?
I don't know, man.

3776
05:55:35,934 --> 05:55:38,936
I'm just the middleman. I
swear! I'm just the middleman!

3777
05:55:43,775 --> 05:55:45,484
Wait, wait, wait.

3778
05:55:46,069 --> 05:55:49,863
I don't know shit, man. I swear. I
just run cars for Braga, all right?

3779
05:55:49,948 --> 05:55:52,741
All I can do is get you in
the race! That's all I can do!

3780
05:55:52,826 --> 05:55:54,201
What race?

3781
05:55:59,666 --> 05:56:01,416
Help! Come on,
hold on!

3782
05:56:01,501 --> 05:56:03,877
Let me up, man!
Come on!

3783
05:56:15,056 --> 05:56:17,891
Come on, man, I don't
know shit! Just let me up!

3784
05:56:17,976 --> 05:56:20,143
I told you, you got to talk to Braga!

3785
05:56:20,228 --> 05:56:21,186
Bring him up, Dom.

3786
05:56:21,271 --> 05:56:23,981
God! Don't drop me!
That's all I know!

3787
05:56:25,066 --> 05:56:26,567
Bring him up.

3788
05:56:26,651 --> 05:56:29,152
You here to take
me in, O'Conner?

3789
05:56:29,612 --> 05:56:32,155
Shit! Shit!
Shut up!

3790
05:56:35,034 --> 05:56:36,743
Letty was my friend, too.

3791
05:56:36,828 --> 05:56:38,453
You weren't
anyone's friend.

3792
05:56:38,538 --> 05:56:41,665
Yo, can you guys talk about
this later? Now pull my ass up!

3793
05:56:41,749 --> 05:56:44,042
She was running for this guy,
Braga, and things went bad.

3794
05:56:44,127 --> 05:56:45,168
Please!

3795
05:56:45,253 --> 05:56:47,880
I'm going to
get these guys, Dom.

3796
05:56:47,964 --> 05:56:50,173
Now let me do my job
and bring him up.

3797
05:56:50,258 --> 05:56:52,718
I'm going to
kill this Braga.

3798
05:56:54,637 --> 05:56:55,846
God!

3799
05:56:56,264 --> 05:56:59,016
And anyone else
who gets in my way.

3800
05:57:03,271 --> 05:57:04,479
Hey!

3801
05:57:05,148 --> 05:57:06,690
Don't let go.

3802
05:57:15,575 --> 05:57:16,867
O'Conner!

3803
05:57:18,620 --> 05:57:22,289
O'Conner! If you ever release
a witness of mine again...

3804
05:57:26,669 --> 05:57:28,587
That's enough! STASIAK: Don't touch me.

3805
05:57:28,671 --> 05:57:30,088
I'm fine! PENNING: That's enough.

3806
05:57:30,173 --> 05:57:33,383
You're through, O'Conner!
I said that's enough!

3807
05:57:34,886 --> 05:57:36,428
Stasiak, go get
yourself cleaned up.

3808
05:57:36,512 --> 05:57:38,764
What?
He hit me first! You...

3809
05:57:38,848 --> 05:57:40,849
This isn't
the Cub Scouts!

3810
05:57:40,934 --> 05:57:44,186
Now, go on! You're bleeding on my floor.

3811
05:57:53,780 --> 05:57:56,615
O'Conner, do you know the difference
between a cop and a criminal?

3812
05:57:56,699 --> 05:57:59,117
What?
One bad judgment call.

3813
05:58:00,620 --> 05:58:02,788
Keep your shit in line,
son.

3814
05:58:06,751 --> 05:58:08,502
Have a good time.

3815
05:58:11,506 --> 05:58:13,173
Take a seat.

3816
05:58:17,095 --> 05:58:21,723
Good news. We have intel that
Braga's number two, Ramon Campos,

3817
05:58:21,808 --> 05:58:23,976
will hold a street race
in Koreatown tomorrow night

3818
05:58:24,060 --> 05:58:26,228
to fill a slot
on his team.

3819
05:58:26,771 --> 05:58:29,439
They've already chosen three
drivers from previous races.

3820
05:58:30,942 --> 05:58:33,068
Our newest informant,
Mr. David Park,

3821
05:58:33,152 --> 05:58:35,904
has been kind enough
to get us into the race.

3822
05:58:38,408 --> 05:58:40,617
O'Conner, you're up.

3823
05:58:41,452 --> 05:58:44,037
Let me guess,
winner gets the slot.

3824
05:58:49,585 --> 05:58:52,337
All right, so these are all the
imports the city has in impound.

3825
05:58:52,422 --> 05:58:54,548
Okay, nice.
Pick your poison.

3826
05:58:54,632 --> 05:58:57,843
All right, 2206.
I crashed one of those.

3827
05:58:57,927 --> 05:59:02,597
3418 and 2765.

3828
05:59:03,933 --> 05:59:05,892
Okay, so which one
do you want?

3829
05:59:05,977 --> 05:59:07,686
I want them all.

3830
05:59:37,675 --> 05:59:39,468
Standard issue
tracking device.

3831
05:59:39,552 --> 05:59:41,470
Boss wants to know where
you are at all times.

3832
06:00:33,981 --> 06:00:35,190
You want to
play with it?

3833
06:00:36,192 --> 06:00:37,317
Hey!

3834
06:00:37,693 --> 06:00:40,112
What are you
looking at, nutsack?

3835
06:00:40,196 --> 06:00:41,947
I don't know.
You tell me.

3836
06:00:42,031 --> 06:00:44,282
The racer wants
what Dwight's got.

3837
06:00:44,367 --> 06:00:47,327
See, but, ladies, Dwight's
already on the team.

3838
06:00:47,411 --> 06:00:49,371
You got to be fast if you
want to drive for Braga.

3839
06:00:49,455 --> 06:00:52,290
Is there a problem here? No.

3840
06:00:54,794 --> 06:00:56,795
You one of
Park's guys, blondie?

3841
06:00:56,879 --> 06:00:58,380
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

3842
06:00:59,132 --> 06:01:00,590
Follow me.

3843
06:01:03,928 --> 06:01:05,720
See you later, punk.

3844
06:01:06,514 --> 06:01:07,722
You, too, punk.

3845
06:01:20,069 --> 06:01:22,237
Bull's-eye, coño,
come on!

3846
06:01:28,286 --> 06:01:29,494
We can do this all day.

3847
06:01:34,709 --> 06:01:37,043
You all know
why you're here.

3848
06:01:37,712 --> 06:01:39,212
Good drivers

3849
06:01:40,882 --> 06:01:42,674
are a dime a dozen.

3850
06:01:43,092 --> 06:01:47,387
Man, every corner's got a
chingadera tuner racing for pinks.

3851
06:01:48,222 --> 06:01:51,224
That's not what Braga
has got me looking for.

3852
06:01:51,809 --> 06:01:56,479
Braga wants someone that would sell
their abuelita to be behind the wheel.

3853
06:01:58,065 --> 06:02:02,152
Someone that drives their 10-second
cars not in a straight line,

3854
06:02:02,236 --> 06:02:06,448
but to push it and make it through
places no one else would take it.

3855
06:02:07,158 --> 06:02:08,742
Real drivers.

3856
06:02:10,870 --> 06:02:12,954
So, what are we hauling?

3857
06:02:13,956 --> 06:02:17,375
For the money Braga's paying,
you don't need to know.

3858
06:02:17,460 --> 06:02:20,128
You just said you wanted real drivers.

3859
06:02:22,048 --> 06:02:25,300
A real driver knows
exactly what's in his car.

3860
06:02:30,348 --> 06:02:32,140
Mira, real driver,

3861
06:02:34,018 --> 06:02:36,228
nobody's forcing you
to race.

3862
06:02:36,312 --> 06:02:38,063
You the boss?

3863
06:02:39,815 --> 06:02:42,108
Or am I talking
to the boss?

3864
06:02:45,071 --> 06:02:46,988
Do I look like a boss?

3865
06:02:49,200 --> 06:02:52,744
My job is to find the
best drivers, period.

3866
06:02:52,828 --> 06:02:56,498
Whoever wins the race
gets the info. We cool?

3867
06:03:01,420 --> 06:03:02,963
Are we cool?

3868
06:03:05,174 --> 06:03:06,841
Yeah, we're cool.

3869
06:03:07,343 --> 06:03:09,344
No,
we ain't cool, man.

3870
06:03:10,054 --> 06:03:12,222
Who's closing these streets?

3871
06:03:14,517 --> 06:03:16,601
No one.
That's the point.

3872
06:03:28,531 --> 06:03:31,741
Please wait while
directions are downloaded.

3873
06:03:37,498 --> 06:03:39,958
Proceed to
the highlighted route.

3874
06:03:40,710 --> 06:03:41,835
Ten,

3875
06:03:43,546 --> 06:03:44,754
nine,

3876
06:03:46,340 --> 06:03:47,590
eight,

3877
06:03:49,260 --> 06:03:50,510
seven,

3878
06:03:51,887 --> 06:03:53,054
six...

3879
06:03:53,097 --> 06:03:56,391
You sure you want to do
this? A lot has changed.

3880
06:03:57,351 --> 06:03:59,185
...four...
You're right.

3881
06:04:00,021 --> 06:04:01,229
...three,

3882
06:04:02,773 --> 06:04:03,940
two,

3883
06:04:05,443 --> 06:04:06,609
one,

3884
06:04:08,029 --> 06:04:09,154
go!

3885
06:04:17,538 --> 06:04:19,247
Right turn ahead.

3886
06:04:22,585 --> 06:04:25,754
You are now five miles
from your destination.

3887
06:04:51,781 --> 06:04:53,615
How's my ass look,
Chia Pet?

3888
06:04:54,450 --> 06:04:55,992
Ghetto Smurf.

3889
06:05:21,102 --> 06:05:22,811
Dead man driving.

3890
06:05:26,440 --> 06:05:27,732
Come on!

3891
06:05:29,026 --> 06:05:30,819
Right turn ahead.

3892
06:05:49,797 --> 06:05:50,964
Shit!

3893
06:05:56,262 --> 06:05:57,554
Damn.

3894
06:05:57,638 --> 06:06:07,480
Rerouting.

3895
06:06:16,115 --> 06:06:18,283
Proceed straight ahead.

3896
06:06:22,580 --> 06:06:23,955
Rerouting.

3897
06:06:33,757 --> 06:06:34,966
Shit.

3898
06:06:36,427 --> 06:06:38,636
Rerouting.
Just shut up!

3899
06:06:42,433 --> 06:06:45,852
You are 2.6 miles
from destination.

3900
06:06:48,731 --> 06:06:50,440
Oops, I didn't see you.

3901
06:06:52,902 --> 06:06:56,905
You are now four and one-half
miles from your destination.

3902
06:07:29,605 --> 06:07:32,482
U- turn, if possible.
Are you kidding me?

3903
06:07:32,566 --> 06:07:36,611
You are now 4.2 miles
from your destination.

3904
06:07:38,447 --> 06:07:39,864
Sorry, car.

3905
06:07:47,164 --> 06:07:49,666
You are now one mile
from your destination.

3906
06:07:49,750 --> 06:07:51,960
Yeah,
guess who's back, Dom?

3907
06:07:54,880 --> 06:07:56,214
Let's go!

3908
06:08:00,678 --> 06:08:02,303
Nice car, baby!

3909
06:08:46,974 --> 06:08:48,182
Bitch!

3910
06:08:49,518 --> 06:08:52,604
You are now one-quarter
mile from your destination.

3911
06:09:11,248 --> 06:09:12,874
Too early, Dom.

3912
06:09:32,102 --> 06:09:33,144
No!

3913
06:09:33,729 --> 06:09:35,521
Still a buster.

3914
06:09:38,942 --> 06:09:42,070
You have reached your
destination. Goodbye.

3915
06:09:54,249 --> 06:09:57,126
At least we know you
can't beat me straight up.

3916
06:09:57,211 --> 06:09:59,003
I didn't know
there were any rules.

3917
06:10:00,964 --> 06:10:02,674
Now that's what I call
real driving.

3918
06:10:02,758 --> 06:10:04,133
No, that's bullshit, man!

3919
06:10:04,218 --> 06:10:06,177
Go cry to your mama, eh?

3920
06:10:08,597 --> 06:10:10,598
You work for Braga now.

3921
06:10:11,016 --> 06:10:13,810
When the GPS calls,
you follow.

3922
06:10:18,816 --> 06:10:20,608
Driver's license.

3923
06:10:20,693 --> 06:10:23,277
What driver's license?

3924
06:10:23,821 --> 06:10:25,363
Thumb.

3925
06:10:30,035 --> 06:10:31,828
Cell phone number.

3926
06:10:36,917 --> 06:10:39,127
The print is for Campos.

3927
06:10:39,795 --> 06:10:41,671
The number is for me.

3928
06:10:45,134 --> 06:10:46,509
Yo, nutsack!

3929
06:10:46,593 --> 06:10:50,179
Let me tell you something, man,
muscle beats import every time.

3930
06:10:50,264 --> 06:10:53,057
You know what I'm saying? Every time!

3931
06:10:53,934 --> 06:10:56,978
Ladies, let's get on
back to Papa Dwight's.

3932
06:11:03,610 --> 06:11:06,654
Papa Dwight wants you
to take off your shoes.

3933
06:11:07,322 --> 06:11:10,283
Dwight likes feet.
Take off your shoes.

3934
06:11:11,201 --> 06:11:12,744
So beautiful.

3935
06:11:14,872 --> 06:11:16,873
Dwight likes this foot a lot.

3936
06:11:25,174 --> 06:11:26,591
Yes, baby!

3937
06:11:27,760 --> 06:11:29,969
Daddy Dwight loves...
FBl!

3938
06:11:31,847 --> 06:11:34,891
I didn't do nothing, man!
Dwight didn't do nothing!

3939
06:11:35,017 --> 06:11:37,477
Hey, no! Stay, stay! Where
you going? Bye, Dwight!

3940
06:11:37,561 --> 06:11:38,770
No, what did I do?

3941
06:11:39,980 --> 06:11:42,064
You're under arrest
for distribution of meth.

3942
06:11:42,149 --> 06:11:45,485
Meth? Dwight's never
touched that shit, bro!

3943
06:11:45,569 --> 06:11:46,611
Dwight has now.

3944
06:11:46,695 --> 06:11:49,071
Yo, that ain't mine! No!

3945
06:11:49,156 --> 06:11:51,282
You know that's never
gonna stick, right?

3946
06:11:51,366 --> 06:11:53,618
Yeah, it's not
supposed to.

3947
06:11:56,371 --> 06:11:58,289
Live it up!
Live it up!

3948
06:12:53,762 --> 06:12:55,263
Yeah, Corona.

3949
06:12:58,267 --> 06:12:59,642
That's too bad
about Dwight.

3950
06:12:59,726 --> 06:13:03,187
Having the Feds raid your house
the same night you make the team.

3951
06:13:03,272 --> 06:13:05,273
So unfortunate.

3952
06:13:05,357 --> 06:13:08,776
I wish I could say I was
surprised to see you here.

3953
06:13:10,362 --> 06:13:13,614
What's to stop someone from
telling them you're a cop?

3954
06:13:13,699 --> 06:13:17,451
Probably the same thing that's keeping me
from telling them why you're really here.

3955
06:13:17,536 --> 06:13:19,745
What up, fellows?
Hey, how you doing?

3956
06:13:19,830 --> 06:13:22,498
Great. You having a good
time? Yeah, a great time.

3957
06:13:22,583 --> 06:13:25,126
Come on, let's have a better time.

3958
06:13:25,669 --> 06:13:29,213
How's your car?
It took a nasty bump.

3959
06:13:29,298 --> 06:13:30,840
It'll be ready.

3960
06:13:30,924 --> 06:13:34,260
I also heard you just
got out of County.

3961
06:13:34,344 --> 06:13:35,928
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

3962
06:13:36,263 --> 06:13:38,014
You know a guy
named Jim Garcia?

3963
06:13:38,098 --> 06:13:42,143
Nah. Big place. Lots
of names, lots of faces.

3964
06:13:43,645 --> 06:13:46,689
And you, you're wanted by
a lot of people, homes.

3965
06:13:46,773 --> 06:13:49,358
Yeah, that kind of heat
can't be good for business.

3966
06:13:49,443 --> 06:13:52,361
Yeah, well, that depends
on how you look at things.

3967
06:13:52,446 --> 06:13:54,822
I go down, I do time.

3968
06:13:55,866 --> 06:13:57,533
I do real time.

3969
06:13:58,577 --> 06:14:03,122
I don't know about your other drivers, but
when I see flashing lights in my mirror,

3970
06:14:03,206 --> 06:14:04,707
I don't stop.

3971
06:14:10,088 --> 06:14:12,089
Do you know each other?

3972
06:14:16,178 --> 06:14:18,346
He used to date
my sister.

3973
06:14:19,431 --> 06:14:20,765
I see.

3974
06:14:23,185 --> 06:14:25,728
You're a lucky man.
How's that?

3975
06:14:26,772 --> 06:14:28,773
You're still breathing.

3976
06:14:34,821 --> 06:14:38,866
To the ladies we've loved
and the ladies we've lost.

3977
06:14:47,584 --> 06:14:49,627
So, what's Braga about?

3978
06:14:51,546 --> 06:14:53,422
You know,
he's just one of us.

3979
06:14:53,507 --> 06:14:56,968
Came up from the streets.
Down for el barrio.

3980
06:14:57,052 --> 06:14:59,261
Now he's a shot caller.

3981
06:15:00,097 --> 06:15:01,973
The boss of bosses.

3982
06:15:02,599 --> 06:15:04,892
See all these
cats in here?

3983
06:15:05,477 --> 06:15:08,145
Any one of them
would die for Braga.

3984
06:15:08,230 --> 06:15:09,855
Including you?

3985
06:15:11,984 --> 06:15:13,609
Especially me.

3986
06:15:23,412 --> 06:15:25,162
Enjoy the party, fellows.
Club's yours.

3987
06:15:25,247 --> 06:15:28,499
Whatever you want, booze,
broads, it's all good.

3988
06:15:31,920 --> 06:15:33,462
Braga's mine.

3989
06:15:37,050 --> 06:15:39,427
I'm taking the
whole house down.

3990
06:15:40,220 --> 06:15:41,595
Good luck.

3991
06:17:49,391 --> 06:17:52,101
Something interests you
about this car?

3992
06:17:52,727 --> 06:17:54,979
Just admiring
the body work.

3993
06:17:56,565 --> 06:18:00,568
Are you one of those boys
who prefers cars to women?

3994
06:18:04,030 --> 06:18:08,742
I'm one of those boys that appreciates
a fine body, regardless of the make.

3995
06:18:12,414 --> 06:18:13,873
Your car?

3996
06:18:17,919 --> 06:18:19,587
It's Fenix's car.

3997
06:18:20,797 --> 06:18:24,884
You'll meet him at the
rendezvous. He'll be leading you.

3998
06:18:26,386 --> 06:18:27,761
So now

3999
06:18:29,181 --> 06:18:31,557
that I know
your taste in cars,

4000
06:18:31,641 --> 06:18:34,185
tell me, what about your women?

4001
06:18:36,188 --> 06:18:38,355
It all starts
with the eyes.

4002
06:18:40,859 --> 06:18:46,030
She's got to have those kind of eyes
that can look right through the bullshit

4003
06:18:46,114 --> 06:18:48,240
to the good in someone.

4004
06:18:52,871 --> 06:18:56,040
20% angel,
80% devil.

4005
06:18:57,709 --> 06:18:59,543
Down to earth.

4006
06:19:01,379 --> 06:19:05,549
Ain't afraid to get a little
engine grease under her fingernails.

4007
06:19:12,515 --> 06:19:15,142
That doesn't sound
anything like me.

4008
06:19:17,812 --> 06:19:19,146
It ain't.

4009
06:19:27,239 --> 06:19:28,239
Hi.
Hi.

4010
06:19:28,323 --> 06:19:31,408
I got a gift for you.
All right.

4011
06:19:31,493 --> 06:19:34,036
A dirty shot glass,
just what I always wanted.

4012
06:19:34,120 --> 06:19:35,704
I got these from the club last night.

4013
06:19:35,789 --> 06:19:37,748
There's two sets of
prints here. Run them both.

4014
06:19:37,832 --> 06:19:41,335
I know one of these is Campos'. I
think the other might be Braga's.

4015
06:19:41,419 --> 06:19:43,963
And you're gonna have
to go beyond Interpol.

4016
06:19:44,047 --> 06:19:46,423
So, that means I have to
contact individual agencies,

4017
06:19:46,508 --> 06:19:49,051
and that could
take weeks. Okay.

4018
06:20:04,150 --> 06:20:05,109
Yeah.

4019
06:20:05,193 --> 06:20:08,362
That's your third traffic
violation in less than three blocks.

4020
06:20:08,446 --> 06:20:10,447
Slow it down,
O'Conner.

4021
06:20:11,116 --> 06:20:12,825
Sure thing, Dad.

4022
06:20:41,896 --> 06:20:42,980
He stopped.

4023
06:21:37,619 --> 06:21:39,036
We lost him.

4024
06:21:39,120 --> 06:21:40,621
He killed the tracker.
We don't know that.

4025
06:21:40,747 --> 06:21:42,956
I'm telling you, he killed the
tracker. We don't know that yet!

4026
06:21:43,041 --> 06:21:44,958
Get the bird overhead.

4027
06:21:46,086 --> 06:21:49,129
Right now, I'm moving north, 33', 56'...

4028
06:21:53,134 --> 06:21:54,510
All clear.

4029
06:22:17,450 --> 06:22:19,743
Base, flag nine,
I'm at Angels 5.

4030
06:22:19,828 --> 06:22:23,455
I don't have a tally on the target.
Repeat, I don't have a tally on the target.

4031
06:22:23,540 --> 06:22:25,249
They're gone, there's no one down there.

4032
06:22:25,333 --> 06:22:26,667
Damn it!

4033
06:22:37,720 --> 06:22:42,516
This ain't right, bro. Nobody said
nothing about being locked in no truck.

4034
06:22:42,600 --> 06:22:44,351
Tell me about it.

4035
06:22:47,105 --> 06:22:48,856
Hey. Hey!

4036
06:22:50,567 --> 06:22:53,610
Yo! Where do you think
they're taking us?

4037
06:22:53,695 --> 06:22:55,279
Don't matter.

4038
06:22:58,199 --> 06:23:01,034
We're all just along
for the ride now.

4039
06:23:12,130 --> 06:23:14,131
Welcome to Mexico, boys.

4040
06:23:19,888 --> 06:23:22,264
There are helicopters
and surveillance cameras

4041
06:23:22,348 --> 06:23:24,808
that scan for heat
signatures at the border.

4042
06:23:24,893 --> 06:23:28,854
But there are blind spots that I
can guide you through via satellite.

4043
06:23:28,938 --> 06:23:33,442
There can be no margin of error, so
you must follow my every direction.

4044
06:23:34,152 --> 06:23:35,527
Any questions?

4045
06:23:37,572 --> 06:23:40,115
I thought Fenix
was gonna be here.

4046
06:23:43,286 --> 06:23:45,370
He'll meet you
out there.

4047
06:23:50,251 --> 06:23:52,586
All right, everybody, sync up.

4048
06:23:55,381 --> 06:23:57,257
Good luck, gentlemen.

4049
06:24:10,688 --> 06:24:12,272
Satellite linkup engaged.

4050
06:24:13,608 --> 06:24:16,652
Keep proceeding northbound
at current speed.

4051
06:24:20,615 --> 06:24:22,491
Stay close to Fenix.

4052
06:24:23,660 --> 06:24:25,118
He'll lead you across.

4053
06:24:39,300 --> 06:24:42,844
I got a heat signature
northbound along Lagardo Ravine.

4054
06:24:45,306 --> 06:24:49,851
Thermal imaging window on the Mexico
side's gonna be down for about 45 seconds.

4055
06:24:49,936 --> 06:24:51,812
Get the camera on it.

4056
06:24:51,896 --> 06:24:55,732
Manual override. Rerouting
camera to designated coordinates.

4057
06:24:58,903 --> 06:25:01,697
Hurry it up.
You guys have been tagged.

4058
06:25:11,499 --> 06:25:12,833
Shit.

4059
06:25:14,002 --> 06:25:16,420
Toretto,
get back in formation.

4060
06:25:19,591 --> 06:25:20,674
Reimaging commencing.

4061
06:25:29,475 --> 06:25:31,393
I don't see anything.

4062
06:25:31,477 --> 06:25:32,686
They're gone.

4063
06:25:34,731 --> 06:25:36,690
Get the helicopters
to cover it.

4064
06:25:40,778 --> 06:25:43,905
Base, we're 40 seconds
out from Lagardo Ravine.

4065
06:25:44,782 --> 06:25:46,408
They're sending
a helicopter.

4066
06:25:48,036 --> 06:25:49,911
You have 30 seconds.

4067
06:25:58,713 --> 06:26:01,840
North 32' 33',
west 116' 49'.

4068
06:26:08,348 --> 06:26:10,140
The window
is closing fast.

4069
06:26:10,224 --> 06:26:13,393
You need to get out of there
before they send ground support.

4070
06:26:19,609 --> 06:26:21,276
Fifteen seconds.

4071
06:26:26,741 --> 06:26:29,076
Base,
target is at two miles.

4072
06:26:42,256 --> 06:26:44,466
You're running
out of time.

4073
06:26:47,512 --> 06:26:49,596
You need to get out now!

4074
06:27:01,567 --> 06:27:05,570
Base, we're at north
32' 33', west 116' 49'.

4075
06:27:05,655 --> 06:27:09,533
We have no visual contact. Roll
ground units for confirmation.

4076
06:27:30,471 --> 06:27:31,805
Sloppy!

4077
06:27:32,473 --> 06:27:34,015
Very sloppy!

4078
06:27:39,647 --> 06:27:41,690
What are you doing, man?

4079
06:27:44,193 --> 06:27:45,527
Come on.

4080
06:27:48,656 --> 06:27:49,990
Get out.

4081
06:27:53,453 --> 06:27:54,703
Come on, man.

4082
06:27:54,787 --> 06:27:56,747
Come on, today, man.
Come on, let's go.

4083
06:27:56,831 --> 06:27:58,707
Hey, don't touch me.
Hey, don't touch me, man!

4084
06:28:00,084 --> 06:28:01,793
Hey, I said don't touch me, man!

4085
06:28:01,878 --> 06:28:03,420
Hey, look, dawg, don't
put your hands on me.

4086
06:28:03,504 --> 06:28:05,005
Hey,
Malik, chill, bro.

4087
06:28:05,131 --> 06:28:06,339
Yo, man, what's up
with your boy?

4088
06:28:06,424 --> 06:28:08,300
Hey, boss man!

4089
06:28:11,220 --> 06:28:12,929
What did you say?

4090
06:28:13,014 --> 06:28:16,767
I said only pussies
run nitrometh.

4091
06:28:19,395 --> 06:28:21,480
You looked under my hood?

4092
06:28:28,362 --> 06:28:30,071
I'm talking to you.

4093
06:28:30,156 --> 06:28:32,365
Got something on your mind?

4094
06:28:33,201 --> 06:28:34,534
'70 Plymouth.

4095
06:28:37,538 --> 06:28:38,830
Her name was Letty.

4096
06:28:38,900 --> 06:28:41,234
And somebody
wrecked her car.

4097
06:28:46,600 --> 06:28:47,850
I wrecked her car.

4098
06:28:51,100 --> 06:28:52,142
You remember her face?

4099
06:28:56,200 --> 06:28:57,200
Huh?

4100
06:28:58,076 --> 06:28:59,702
'Cause I don't.

4101
06:29:01,079 --> 06:29:03,748
Last time I saw it,
it was burning.

4102
06:29:17,554 --> 06:29:18,930
Now what?

4103
06:29:20,557 --> 06:29:23,309
I'm going to enjoy
what happens next.

4104
06:29:57,386 --> 06:29:58,886
Dom, get in!

4105
06:30:00,180 --> 06:30:01,847
Get in! Come on!

4106
06:30:03,850 --> 06:30:07,687
Come on! Get in the fucking
car! Let's go! Hurry up!

4107
06:30:34,673 --> 06:30:36,299
What
have you got, Trinh?

4108
06:30:36,383 --> 06:30:38,968
We're contacting agencies
in multiple countries.

4109
06:30:39,052 --> 06:30:44,056
Unfortunately, most of them have to
manually scan their prints for us to upload.

4110
06:30:44,891 --> 06:30:46,976
O'Conner's on line five.

4111
06:30:47,060 --> 06:30:49,145
And, sir,
you should see this.

4112
06:30:49,229 --> 06:30:50,730
Thank you.

4113
06:31:01,116 --> 06:31:02,241
Talk to me, O'Conner.

4114
06:31:02,701 --> 06:31:04,869
Where the hell have you
been? I got the shipment.

4115
06:31:04,953 --> 06:31:07,955
"I got the shipment,"
or "we got the shipment?"

4116
06:31:08,040 --> 06:31:10,082
What are you
talking about?

4117
06:31:10,167 --> 06:31:14,628
Traffic cams in the area picked up
pictures of you and Toretto together.

4118
06:31:15,756 --> 06:31:20,509
Listen to me, O'Conner. Bring in
the shipment and bring in Toretto.

4119
06:31:20,927 --> 06:31:23,596
But I thought the point was to get
Braga. We got an opportunity here.

4120
06:31:23,680 --> 06:31:26,265
Brian, the clock
stopped ticking.

4121
06:31:27,142 --> 06:31:29,435
Bring them in.
Are we clear?

4122
06:31:33,774 --> 06:31:35,107
O'Conner?

4123
06:31:45,118 --> 06:31:47,953
So this is what
$60 million looks like.

4124
06:31:49,706 --> 06:31:52,333
Yeah, we got to
get you to a doctor.

4125
06:31:52,417 --> 06:31:55,086
We got to find
a place to hide this.

4126
06:31:57,672 --> 06:31:58,839
I got a spot.

4127
06:32:08,934 --> 06:32:11,852
502, wet reckless.
I need a 48-hour hold.

4128
06:32:13,980 --> 06:32:15,815
Out back.
Any spot you can find.

4129
06:32:20,987 --> 06:32:22,863
You sure about this?

4130
06:32:23,824 --> 06:32:29,995
Yeah. The last place they'll check,
their own impound yard. Trust me.

4131
06:32:36,503 --> 06:32:38,379
You know,
I've been thinking,

4132
06:32:38,463 --> 06:32:40,923
when you blew up your car back
there, you blew up mine, too.

4133
06:32:41,007 --> 06:32:43,509
Yeah?
Yeah.

4134
06:32:43,593 --> 06:32:46,178
So now you owe me
a 10-second car.

4135
06:32:47,514 --> 06:32:49,765
Is that right?
Yeah.

4136
06:33:01,027 --> 06:33:02,736
Now we're even.

4137
06:33:18,420 --> 06:33:21,297
Is this your way of
keeping me away from him?

4138
06:33:21,423 --> 06:33:25,259
You're the only one I could
call. He's my brother, of course.

4139
06:33:32,893 --> 06:33:34,977
The bullet's not in there.

4140
06:33:42,527 --> 06:33:46,489
I'm gonna clean it and stitch
it up. It's going to hurt.

4141
06:33:46,573 --> 06:33:49,033
I bet you're going
to enjoy this.

4142
06:33:49,701 --> 06:33:51,035
A little.

4143
06:33:53,997 --> 06:33:56,415
Want some of this?
Yeah.

4144
06:33:56,500 --> 06:33:58,542
It's spicy.

4145
06:34:00,295 --> 06:34:01,921
I like it hot.

4146
06:34:03,048 --> 06:34:05,257
Dom, what are you doing?

4147
06:34:05,342 --> 06:34:08,260
You reached first,
you have to say grace.

4148
06:34:18,563 --> 06:34:22,441
Thank you, Lord,
for blessing this table.

4149
06:34:23,902 --> 06:34:28,656
With food, family
and friendship.

4150
06:35:02,399 --> 06:35:04,733
You asked me
why I let Dom go.

4151
06:35:06,820 --> 06:35:09,488
I think it's because
at that moment,

4152
06:35:11,199 --> 06:35:14,034
I respected him
more than I did myself.

4153
06:35:18,415 --> 06:35:19,623
Yeah.

4154
06:35:21,209 --> 06:35:26,338
One thing I learned from Dom is that nothing
really matters unless you have a code.

4155
06:35:29,551 --> 06:35:31,844
And what's your code,
Brian?

4156
06:35:34,222 --> 06:35:36,015
I'm working on it.

4157
06:36:10,884 --> 06:36:12,426
Shit. Hey, Dom.

4158
06:36:12,552 --> 06:36:15,095
When were you gonna tell
me? Dom, what are you doing?

4159
06:36:15,180 --> 06:36:17,139
When were you gonna tell me
you were running Letty?

4160
06:36:17,223 --> 06:36:19,558
Let me explain...
When were you gonna...

4161
06:36:24,981 --> 06:36:26,273
Dom, stop!

4162
06:36:26,358 --> 06:36:28,525
You don't understand.
I don't understand?

4163
06:36:28,610 --> 06:36:29,818
Stop!

4164
06:36:33,990 --> 06:36:35,199
She did it for...

4165
06:36:38,286 --> 06:36:39,828
Dom, stop!

4166
06:36:39,913 --> 06:36:42,039
Dom, stop it!
Please stop!

4167
06:36:51,466 --> 06:36:55,094
She did it for you, Dom!
She did it for you!

4168
06:36:59,599 --> 06:37:03,936
Letty came to me to clear your name
in exchange for bringing down Braga.

4169
06:37:06,981 --> 06:37:09,483
She just wanted you
to come home!

4170
06:37:26,668 --> 06:37:28,460
I'm sorry, Dom!

4171
06:37:28,545 --> 06:37:29,962
I'm sorry!

4172
06:37:54,821 --> 06:38:00,659
You better have one hell of an
explanation. You disobeyed a direct order.

4173
06:38:01,536 --> 06:38:03,537
Where's the shipment?
It's safe.

4174
06:38:03,621 --> 06:38:05,414
It's safe.

4175
06:38:05,498 --> 06:38:08,375
Look, we could use the shipment
to parade in front of the media,

4176
06:38:08,460 --> 06:38:10,377
get a few hundred pounds
of heroin off the street,

4177
06:38:10,462 --> 06:38:14,173
but Braga's just gonna send another
shipment next week and the week after that.

4178
06:38:14,257 --> 06:38:16,383
Let's use the shipment
to lure Braga out

4179
06:38:16,468 --> 06:38:18,510
and lop the head off
a multi-billion dollar cartel.

4180
06:38:18,595 --> 06:38:20,971
And how do you
suggest we do that?

4181
06:38:21,055 --> 06:38:23,015
A hand-to-hand
exchange with Braga.

4182
06:38:23,099 --> 06:38:24,475
He'll never show.

4183
06:38:24,559 --> 06:38:26,351
He can't afford not to.

4184
06:38:36,488 --> 06:38:38,155
You got a plan?

4185
06:38:39,657 --> 06:38:41,325
There's a price.

4186
06:38:44,204 --> 06:38:46,997
We bag Braga,
you let Toretto walk.

4187
06:38:55,799 --> 06:38:58,008
Yes?
It's Dom.

4188
06:38:59,052 --> 06:39:01,345
I was just
thinking about you.

4189
06:39:01,721 --> 06:39:05,641
You know, when I gave you my
number, I was hoping you'd call.

4190
06:39:06,226 --> 06:39:08,769
But not under
these circumstances.

4191
06:39:09,103 --> 06:39:12,231
What circumstances?
Me being alive?

4192
06:39:13,274 --> 06:39:15,234
Don't take it personally.

4193
06:39:15,735 --> 06:39:17,653
It's just business.

4194
06:39:17,737 --> 06:39:19,321
I got some business
of my own.

4195
06:39:20,615 --> 06:39:22,074
Get Campos.

4196
06:39:24,577 --> 06:39:25,994
It's them.

4197
06:39:30,333 --> 06:39:31,333
Uh-huh.

4198
06:39:31,584 --> 06:39:35,587
Was that how Braga inspires
loyalty? Killing his drivers?

4199
06:39:36,089 --> 06:39:38,423
One can always
find more drivers.

4200
06:39:38,675 --> 06:39:40,676
It's just good business.

4201
06:39:40,927 --> 06:39:42,177
I want to trade.

4202
06:39:42,470 --> 06:39:44,513
Braga doesn't negotiate.

4203
06:39:44,597 --> 06:39:45,597
Fine.

4204
06:39:45,682 --> 06:39:50,561
You explain to him how all of a sudden
$60 million worth of product disappears.

4205
06:39:51,271 --> 06:39:53,564
I know that can't
be good for business.

4206
06:39:54,649 --> 06:39:56,191
What do you want?

4207
06:39:56,693 --> 06:40:00,946
Six million cash,
delivered by Braga himself.

4208
06:40:03,616 --> 06:40:05,242
I don't like being shot at.

4209
06:40:05,618 --> 06:40:08,871
I ain't gonna put my neck out again
unless he's got something to lose, too.

4210
06:40:08,955 --> 06:40:10,539
He'll never go for it.

4211
06:40:10,623 --> 06:40:14,251
Either I deal with Braga,
or you do.

4212
06:40:18,256 --> 06:40:19,798
When and where?

4213
06:40:34,856 --> 06:40:38,775
Sir, players are onsite. Holding
positions at the perimeter.

4214
06:40:39,235 --> 06:40:41,820
All right. Listen up.
Everybody stay frosty.

4215
06:40:41,905 --> 06:40:44,573
We don't move a muscle until
O'Conner gives the signal.

4216
06:40:44,657 --> 06:40:47,367
When he gets the money,
you know what to do.

4217
06:40:47,952 --> 06:40:50,412
Well, the good news is,
when we get this guy,

4218
06:40:50,496 --> 06:40:52,915
you walk out of here
a free man.

4219
06:40:53,291 --> 06:40:54,708
Is that what
they told you?

4220
06:40:54,792 --> 06:40:56,418
Yeah, that's the deal.

4221
06:40:56,502 --> 06:40:59,922
You still put milk and
cookies out for Santa Claus?

4222
06:41:01,215 --> 06:41:02,382
Yeah.

4223
06:41:07,180 --> 06:41:08,263
Here.

4224
06:41:08,348 --> 06:41:10,432
In case things go shitty.

4225
06:41:15,396 --> 06:41:17,439
Just like old times?

4226
06:41:17,523 --> 06:41:18,815
Yeah.

4227
06:41:22,403 --> 06:41:23,695
You dropped something.

4228
06:41:23,780 --> 06:41:25,948
That's what you wanted, right? Dom...

4229
06:41:41,047 --> 06:41:43,674
He's harmless.
Don't worry about him.

4230
06:41:45,426 --> 06:41:47,928
And he's really
sorry about Letty.

4231
06:41:50,056 --> 06:41:51,848
Where's our stuff?

4232
06:41:54,602 --> 06:41:57,896
You mean the stuff that
used to be in here, right?

4233
06:41:59,065 --> 06:42:02,859
Well, you'll see it when we
see Braga. That was the deal.

4234
06:42:03,820 --> 06:42:05,237
No worries.

4235
06:42:05,613 --> 06:42:07,614
Braga keeps his word.

4236
06:42:51,617 --> 06:42:53,118
$2 million.

4237
06:42:54,203 --> 06:42:56,955
You get the rest
when I get my property.

4238
06:43:01,294 --> 06:43:02,919
Stasiak.
We got a match.

4239
06:43:03,004 --> 06:43:05,047
The fingerprint's
Braga's 100%.

4240
06:43:05,131 --> 06:43:07,591
Just waiting on facial
confirmation via fax.

4241
06:43:07,675 --> 06:43:09,634
I got
a question for you.

4242
06:43:09,719 --> 06:43:13,472
You wearing pink when you were
clawing your way out of el barrio?

4243
06:43:14,724 --> 06:43:16,183
Order all agents
to move in.

4244
06:43:16,267 --> 06:43:19,394
We got confirmation. Primary
suspect wearing gray suit.

4245
06:43:19,479 --> 06:43:20,479
Let's move.

4246
06:43:20,563 --> 06:43:22,481
Sir, O'Conner hasn't
given us the signal yet.

4247
06:43:22,565 --> 06:43:25,901
What part of that didn't you understand?
We just got confirmation. Do it!

4248
06:43:25,985 --> 06:43:29,321
FBl AGENT: Secure primary
suspect in gray suit. Repeat!

4249
06:43:29,405 --> 06:43:31,990
Secure primary suspect
in gray suit.

4250
06:43:45,463 --> 06:43:48,173
You're thinking what
I'm thinking, right?

4251
06:43:50,968 --> 06:43:52,594
He ain't Braga.

4252
06:43:57,183 --> 06:43:58,183
Oh, shit.

4253
06:43:58,351 --> 06:44:00,602
Drop your weapons!
FBl!

4254
06:44:01,020 --> 06:44:02,312
Get down!

4255
06:44:05,817 --> 06:44:07,526
Get out of here!

4256
06:44:11,614 --> 06:44:13,490
Get out of here, Dom!

4257
06:44:17,787 --> 06:44:19,371
Run him down.

4258
06:44:19,872 --> 06:44:21,081
Go!

4259
06:44:21,749 --> 06:44:23,416
Campos is Braga!

4260
06:44:30,883 --> 06:44:32,175
Come on.

4261
06:44:39,559 --> 06:44:41,685
Approaching primary target.

4262
06:44:42,228 --> 06:44:44,396
Primary suspect is secure.

4263
06:44:47,066 --> 06:44:48,859
He was under your nose
the whole time.

4264
06:44:49,402 --> 06:44:51,153
Now Braga's escaped.

4265
06:44:51,237 --> 06:44:54,197
Toretto's heading south, probably
long across the border by now.

4266
06:44:54,282 --> 06:44:56,491
Do you have any idea the kind
of trouble you're in, O'Conner?

4267
06:44:56,576 --> 06:44:58,535
I was doing my job.

4268
06:44:58,619 --> 06:45:01,163
He ain't the first bad guy you
helped escape the law's grasp.

4269
06:45:01,247 --> 06:45:03,206
As of now, you're being
taken off active duty,

4270
06:45:03,291 --> 06:45:06,251
until this house can
mount a formal inquiry.

4271
06:45:08,421 --> 06:45:10,172
What about Braga?

4272
06:45:11,257 --> 06:45:13,592
That's no longer
your concern.

4273
06:45:23,978 --> 06:45:25,478
We now know where Braga is, right?

4274
06:45:25,563 --> 06:45:29,024
Customs tracked him via satellite
to his home base in Tecali, Mexico.

4275
06:45:29,108 --> 06:45:31,526
Mexico is out
of our jurisdiction.

4276
06:45:34,322 --> 06:45:35,906
The fact is

4277
06:45:35,990 --> 06:45:40,076
the brass will be so busy holding
press conferences over the seizure,

4278
06:45:40,161 --> 06:45:42,287
we'll skate
under the radar.

4279
06:45:42,747 --> 06:45:45,790
I thought we signed on
to do the right thing.

4280
06:46:24,163 --> 06:46:26,289
Everyone's looking for you.

4281
06:46:26,666 --> 06:46:28,291
I'm right here.

4282
06:46:29,585 --> 06:46:30,919
It's nice to see you've
gone with the times

4283
06:46:31,003 --> 06:46:34,589
and switched to electronic
fuel injection. Looks good.

4284
06:46:35,716 --> 06:46:37,801
Buster became a gearhead.

4285
06:46:41,889 --> 06:46:43,682
I'm going with you.

4286
06:46:47,603 --> 06:46:50,272
I don't plan on
bringing anyone back.

4287
06:46:52,233 --> 06:46:53,566
I know.

4288
06:47:02,326 --> 06:47:03,994
Hit that throttle.

4289
06:47:30,271 --> 06:47:31,396
Hey.

4290
06:48:13,189 --> 06:48:16,191
How do you say goodbye
to your only brother?

4291
06:48:18,361 --> 06:48:19,778
You don't.

4292
06:49:28,681 --> 06:49:31,057
I thought you weren't
gonna show up.

4293
06:49:31,142 --> 06:49:32,767
You saved my life.

4294
06:49:33,644 --> 06:49:36,104
I'm willing to
return the favor.

4295
06:49:39,984 --> 06:49:42,485
This will help
get you to Braga.

4296
06:49:46,699 --> 06:49:47,782
Dom.

4297
06:49:48,784 --> 06:49:51,411
Going in there
is suicide.

4298
06:49:59,962 --> 06:50:01,713
I have no choice.

4299
06:50:05,301 --> 06:50:07,760
You must have
loved her very much.

4300
06:50:25,821 --> 06:50:28,531
So this is where
my jurisdiction ends.

4301
06:50:34,330 --> 06:50:36,498
And this is where
mine begins.

4302
06:52:46,879 --> 06:52:48,755
You ain't forgiven.

4303
06:52:52,217 --> 06:52:54,385
You boys want
to arrest me?

4304
06:52:57,431 --> 06:52:59,474
No, we're beyond that.

4305
06:53:00,559 --> 06:53:03,353
You can't buy your way out of this one.

4306
06:53:04,730 --> 06:53:06,397
You and me...

4307
06:53:07,608 --> 06:53:10,443
You and me,
we're not so different.

4308
06:53:12,196 --> 06:53:13,780
You're no hero.

4309
06:53:24,416 --> 06:53:26,084
You're right.

4310
06:53:29,213 --> 06:53:32,548
And that's why you're going
back across the border.

4311
06:53:38,555 --> 06:53:40,264
But Fenix is mine.

4312
06:53:41,266 --> 06:53:42,350
You got it.

4313
06:54:04,623 --> 06:54:05,748
Shit!

4314
06:54:10,796 --> 06:54:14,340
You'll make it a couple of
miles out, if you're lucky.

4315
06:55:06,894 --> 06:55:09,145
You know where
you're going?

4316
06:55:10,189 --> 06:55:12,356
You want to borrow my GPS?

4317
06:55:16,069 --> 06:55:17,779
Where are your boys at?

4318
06:55:17,863 --> 06:55:19,405
Are they going
to show up or what?

4319
06:55:22,868 --> 06:55:24,911
Careful what you ask for.

4320
06:55:41,220 --> 06:55:43,429
Just stop.
Just stop the car.

4321
06:56:03,617 --> 06:56:05,326
Right behind you.

4322
06:56:20,175 --> 06:56:23,261
Dom, head to the tunnel.
Let's use the tunnel.

4323
06:56:50,497 --> 06:56:52,456
Get out of here, Brian.

4324
06:57:00,215 --> 06:57:03,718
You sure you know where
the tunnels are? You sure?

4325
06:57:04,261 --> 06:57:06,012
Yeah. I'd hold on.

4326
06:57:09,099 --> 06:57:10,766
This might hurt.

4327
06:57:24,156 --> 06:57:26,324
You're in
my world now, baby!

4328
06:57:54,937 --> 06:57:57,480
That's it, baby!
End of the road.

4329
06:57:57,564 --> 06:57:59,023
Now what?

4330
06:57:59,816 --> 06:58:00,900
Game over.

4331
06:58:00,984 --> 06:58:02,526
No, no, no.

4332
06:58:32,140 --> 06:58:33,557
Come on!

4333
06:59:52,763 --> 06:59:53,846
Hey!

4334
06:59:54,973 --> 06:59:56,807
Get me out of here!

4335
07:01:26,940 --> 07:01:28,357
Pussy.

4336
07:01:45,750 --> 07:01:47,376
Let me see that.

4337
07:01:49,921 --> 07:01:52,298
Yeah.
Just keep pressure there.

4338
07:01:52,966 --> 07:01:54,967
You'll be all right.

4339
07:02:00,849 --> 07:02:02,933
You gotta get
out of here.

4340
07:02:05,562 --> 07:02:07,563
I ain't running anymore.

4341
07:02:13,195 --> 07:02:15,279
I gotta ask you
something.

4342
07:02:15,947 --> 07:02:17,072
Yeah?

4343
07:02:17,824 --> 07:02:21,869
You know I would have won that
race if you didn't cheat, right?

4344
07:02:24,956 --> 07:02:26,874
You hit your head hard.

4345
07:02:31,755 --> 07:02:33,631
Don't make me laugh.

4346
07:02:44,309 --> 07:02:45,684
All rise.

4347
07:02:50,982 --> 07:02:52,691
Please be seated.

4348
07:02:56,947 --> 07:02:58,989
Please rise,
Mr. Toretto.

4349
07:03:01,368 --> 07:03:03,661
I've listened
to the testimony

4350
07:03:04,162 --> 07:03:06,288
and taken into
special consideration

4351
07:03:06,373 --> 07:03:10,376
Agent O'Conner's appeal of
clemency on behalf of Mr. Toretto.

4352
07:03:11,336 --> 07:03:14,004
That his actions directly
resulted in the apprehension

4353
07:03:14,089 --> 07:03:16,924
of known drug
trafficker Arturo Braga.

4354
07:03:18,468 --> 07:03:19,843
However,

4355
07:03:21,137 --> 07:03:23,097
this judiciary
finds that

4356
07:03:23,181 --> 07:03:28,018
one right does not make up
for a lifetime worth of wrongs.

4357
07:03:28,687 --> 07:03:30,437
And as such,

4358
07:03:30,522 --> 07:03:35,526
I find that I am forced to level the
maximum sentence under California law.

4359
07:03:37,946 --> 07:03:39,613
Dominic Toretto,

4360
07:03:40,448 --> 07:03:44,451
you are hereby sentenced
to serve 25 years to life

4361
07:03:44,536 --> 07:03:47,621
at the Lompoc maximum
security prison system

4362
07:03:48,373 --> 07:03:51,166
without the possibility
of early parole.

4363
07:03:51,751 --> 07:03:53,585
This court is adjourned.

4364
07:05:39,000 --> 07:05:40,048
Here's what we know so far.

4365
07:05:40,083 --> 07:05:43,670
This is all the aftermath of a daring,
daylight breakout.

4366
07:05:43,705 --> 07:05:45,804
There were 26 high-risk inmates
being transferred...

4367
07:05:45,839 --> 07:05:48,508
A daring midday breakout where everyone
onboard has been accounted for,

4368
07:05:48,543 --> 07:05:50,267
except for one, Dominic Toretto.

4369
07:05:50,302 --> 07:05:51,351
Police have just released the identity

4370
07:05:51,386 --> 07:05:53,930
of the man they believe to have orchestrated
the shocking escape

4371
07:05:53,965 --> 07:05:56,683
that amazingly resulted in no
fatalities this afternoon.

4372
07:05:56,718 --> 07:05:59,609
He is former federal agent, Brian O'Conner.

4373
07:05:59,644 --> 07:06:02,626
A fierce manhunt is underway
for three fugitives tonight.

4374
07:06:02,661 --> 07:06:05,609
Multiple federal and local agencies
have joined forces

4375
07:06:05,644 --> 07:06:07,242
in the search for Dominic Toretto

4376
07:06:07,277 --> 07:06:10,321
and his accomplices Brian O'Conner
and Mia Toretto.

4377
07:06:10,356 --> 07:06:13,717
But despite every eye in the country
looking for them

4378
07:06:13,752 --> 07:06:17,078
where Toretto and O'Conner
are now is anyone's guess.

4379
07:07:33,656 --> 07:07:35,198
It's got to be it, right?

4380
07:07:59,473 --> 07:08:01,357
Let's get out of here.
Whoa, whoa.

4381
07:08:01,809 --> 07:08:02,976
Easy, friends.

4382
07:08:03,011 --> 07:08:04,144
She's with me.

4383
07:08:05,980 --> 07:08:07,731
Mia.

4384
07:08:08,691 --> 07:08:10,317
Vince.

4385
07:08:14,989 --> 07:08:15,989
Buster.

4386
07:08:17,992 --> 07:08:19,492
Come on.

4387
07:08:21,162 --> 07:08:22,412
Dom here yet?

4388
07:08:22,447 --> 07:08:23,712
No.

4389
07:08:23,747 --> 07:08:25,463
When was the last time you heard from him?

4390
07:08:25,498 --> 07:08:28,668
A couple of weeks ago.
Up in Ecuador somewhere.

4391
07:08:31,047 --> 07:08:33,256
How does it feel? What's that?

4392
07:08:34,842 --> 07:08:37,177
To be on the other side of a wanted poster?

4393
07:08:39,388 --> 07:08:40,430
He will show up.

4394
07:08:40,465 --> 07:08:41,723
Yeah.

4395
07:08:47,939 --> 07:08:48,939
Dom's?

4396
07:08:50,691 --> 07:08:51,733
Yeah.

4397
07:08:55,237 --> 07:08:56,321
Time for bed little one.

4398
07:08:56,356 --> 07:08:57,948
Can I bring him?

4399
07:08:57,983 --> 07:08:59,991
Of course.

4400
07:09:00,026 --> 07:09:01,076
Aw.

4401
07:09:03,204 --> 07:09:04,371
Good night.

4402
07:09:22,390 --> 07:09:24,057
Excuse me, sorry.

4403
07:09:30,064 --> 07:09:31,815
Why Rio, Vince?

4404
07:09:34,276 --> 07:09:38,238
You mean after
you screwed everything up in LA?

4405
07:09:40,574 --> 07:09:43,493
Ended up free-falling through
South America, you know,

4406
07:09:43,528 --> 07:09:46,889
hitting every hellhole on the way down.

4407
07:09:46,924 --> 07:09:50,250
Would have kept on going if not for Rosa.

4408
07:10:07,935 --> 07:10:08,935
Does he know?

4409
07:10:21,157 --> 07:10:22,574
So, listen.

4410
07:10:23,576 --> 07:10:25,834
There is a job coming up.

4411
07:10:25,869 --> 07:10:27,836
I was hoping Dom was going to be here by now

4412
07:10:27,871 --> 07:10:31,458
but this one is clean enough
we can do it without him.

4413
07:10:32,251 --> 07:10:36,755
It's a good gig.
Couple of high-end cars, easy targets.

4414
07:10:37,798 --> 07:10:40,800
Guy I know is putting together
a team to swipe them.

4415
07:10:40,835 --> 07:10:43,178
Just need a few more willing bodies.

4416
07:10:43,213 --> 07:10:45,020
I don't know.

4417
07:10:45,055 --> 07:10:47,953
Look, the way the car scene is down here

4418
07:10:47,988 --> 07:10:50,852
we can unload them quick and get top dollar.

4419
07:10:50,887 --> 07:10:52,944
It's easy money.

4420
07:10:52,979 --> 07:10:55,315
And from where I am sitting,

4421
07:10:56,067 --> 07:10:59,569
it looks like you both could use the payday.

4422
07:11:39,276 --> 07:11:40,276
What are you reading?

4423
07:11:41,112 --> 07:11:42,237
Travel guide.

4424
07:11:42,822 --> 07:11:43,863
Yeah?

4425
07:11:47,785 --> 07:11:49,244
Tokyo.

4426
07:11:50,788 --> 07:11:52,080
Moscow.

4427
07:11:55,626 --> 07:11:56,591
Goa.

4428
07:11:56,626 --> 07:11:58,378
You want to know what all of these
places have in common?

4429
07:11:58,712 --> 07:11:59,712
Huh?

4430
07:12:00,548 --> 07:12:02,048
No extradition.

4431
07:12:16,605 --> 07:12:18,523
Here we go.

4432
07:12:34,915 --> 07:12:36,791
Excuse me, buddy.

4433
07:12:51,182 --> 07:12:52,682
Okay.

4434
07:13:16,040 --> 07:13:17,624
Hey, we have found them.

4435
07:13:17,833 --> 07:13:19,459
Yeah, second-to-the-last freighter.

4436
07:13:30,054 --> 07:13:31,436
What is it?

4437
07:13:31,471 --> 07:13:35,183
DEA tags. These cars have been seized.

4438
07:14:16,850 --> 07:14:18,142
Look who showed up.

4439
07:14:19,019 --> 07:14:21,729
God, I am so happy you're okay.

4440
07:14:24,858 --> 07:14:26,199
I thought I told you to lay low.

4441
07:14:26,234 --> 07:14:28,861
Been running on fumes. Had to make a call.

4442
07:14:29,321 --> 07:14:32,240
Hey. Quit talking.
We only got the two-minute window.

4443
07:14:32,866 --> 07:14:34,701
Let's go, Vince.

4444
07:14:37,246 --> 07:14:38,288
I am taking the GT40.

4445
07:15:15,242 --> 07:15:16,409
Ladies first.

4446
07:15:22,583 --> 07:15:23,583
Hey.

4447
07:15:25,169 --> 07:15:26,169
Hey.

4448
07:15:27,338 --> 07:15:28,379
This car suits me better.

4449
07:15:35,929 --> 07:15:37,722
See you, baby.

4450
07:15:44,104 --> 07:15:45,855
It's okay...
we're all going to the same place.

4451
07:15:45,890 --> 07:15:47,690
We will get the car there.

4452
07:15:53,197 --> 07:15:56,032
Change of plans. Wait for my call.

4453
07:15:59,495 --> 07:16:00,536
Let's go.

4454
07:16:17,971 --> 07:16:19,013
Where is she going?

4455
07:16:20,682 --> 07:16:22,475
Where is she going? Hey.

4456
07:16:23,977 --> 07:16:25,061
Hey.

4457
07:16:29,691 --> 07:16:33,111
We're being robbed. Whatever
happens, don't stop the train.

4458
07:16:34,321 --> 07:16:35,405
Go after the girl.

4459
07:16:36,115 --> 07:16:37,115
Hurry up.

4460
07:17:07,146 --> 07:17:09,730
Access card. Get the access card.

4461
07:18:22,513 --> 07:18:23,596
Shit.

4462
07:18:48,455 --> 07:18:50,581
Bridge. There is a bridge.

4463
07:19:05,806 --> 07:19:07,265
Luggage car is clear.

4464
07:19:13,939 --> 07:19:15,314
Freeze.

4465
07:20:15,334 --> 07:20:16,709
Oh, shit.

4466
07:20:47,324 --> 07:20:49,241
You had to make a call, huh?

4467
07:20:49,826 --> 07:20:52,036
Shitty call, O'Conner.

4468
07:20:52,412 --> 07:20:54,163
Shitty call.

4469
07:21:14,101 --> 07:21:16,811
You two stirred up quite a
bit of trouble today.

4470
07:21:18,021 --> 07:21:19,987
Three of my men dead.

4471
07:21:20,022 --> 07:21:22,483
Three DEA agents along with them.

4472
07:21:23,068 --> 07:21:25,382
Of course, this is business

4473
07:21:25,417 --> 07:21:27,697
and sometimes things go astray.

4474
07:21:28,865 --> 07:21:31,123
All I care about is the car.

4475
07:21:31,158 --> 07:21:33,494
Tell me where it is,
and I will let you go.

4476
07:21:36,289 --> 07:21:39,375
This roofing plastic says you're
full of shit.

4477
07:21:40,544 --> 07:21:43,921
I don't know how you guys do business
in your part of the world,

4478
07:21:43,956 --> 07:21:45,047
but here in Rio,

4479
07:21:45,674 --> 07:21:48,759
I like it when all parties
know what they're up against.

4480
07:21:48,794 --> 07:21:50,267
That's funny.

4481
07:21:50,302 --> 07:21:52,930
Because it goes both ways.

4482
07:21:54,766 --> 07:21:55,766
You know,

4483
07:21:58,854 --> 07:22:01,439
I hear your sister is very beautiful.

4484
07:22:03,525 --> 07:22:05,317
Wherever she hides

4485
07:22:06,695 --> 07:22:07,987
I will find her.

4486
07:22:53,742 --> 07:22:58,788
The American fugitives killed three DEA
agents during a train robbery...

4487
07:22:58,823 --> 07:23:01,756
...police warn they are armed
and extremely dangerous.

4488
07:23:01,791 --> 07:23:05,294
Anyone with information should contact
law enforcement immediately...

4489
07:23:16,181 --> 07:23:17,640
Mia?

4490
07:23:18,558 --> 07:23:19,558
Hey.

4491
07:23:22,354 --> 07:23:23,611
You okay?

4492
07:23:23,646 --> 07:23:25,648
Yeah, you all right?

4493
07:23:28,193 --> 07:23:29,235
Hey.

4494
07:23:34,950 --> 07:23:36,867
Hey, yeah.

4495
07:23:38,119 --> 07:23:39,411
Just like a Toretto.

4496
07:23:41,456 --> 07:23:42,456
Where's Vince?

4497
07:23:43,124 --> 07:23:44,375
That's a good question.

4498
07:23:45,836 --> 07:23:47,384
He will be here.

4499
07:23:47,419 --> 07:23:48,594
Guys, we're all over the news.

4500
07:23:48,629 --> 07:23:52,091
They're blaming us for the killing
of those DEA agents on the train.

4501
07:23:52,126 --> 07:23:55,184
Which means we just jumped
to the top of the wanted list.

4502
07:23:55,219 --> 07:23:57,847
The feds have got to show everyone
their agents are off limits

4503
07:23:58,390 --> 07:24:00,724
and they're going to send their best
guys. We got to get out of here.

4504
07:24:01,059 --> 07:24:04,061
One thing we know for sure

4505
07:24:05,522 --> 07:24:07,147
is that they wanted this car.

4506
07:24:08,984 --> 07:24:10,032
Because something is in it.

4507
07:24:10,067 --> 07:24:13,821
If we find out what it is, we will
know what we're up against.

4508
07:24:31,172 --> 07:24:34,029
All right, listen up. The men
we're after are professional runners.

4509
07:24:34,064 --> 07:24:36,886
They like speed and are guaranteed to
go down the hardest possible way

4510
07:24:36,921 --> 07:24:38,310
so make sure you got your funderwear on.

4511
07:24:38,345 --> 07:24:42,120
We find them, we take them as a
team, and we bring them back.

4512
07:24:42,155 --> 07:24:45,359
And above all else, we don't ever,
ever let them get into cars.

4513
07:24:45,394 --> 07:24:48,564
Crime scene is 10 hours old and
counting, men. Let's go hunting.

4514
07:24:52,027 --> 07:24:54,820
Agente Hobbs.
Chief of Police, João Almeida.

4515
07:24:54,855 --> 07:24:56,071
Luke.

4516
07:24:56,656 --> 07:24:59,331
Sorry to hear about the loss of your men.

4517
07:24:59,366 --> 07:25:01,493
Is all this really necessary
to apprehend two men?

4518
07:25:01,528 --> 07:25:03,085
Let me tell you something about these two men.

4519
07:25:03,120 --> 07:25:05,706
One is a former federal officer, been
in deep cover for five years.

4520
07:25:05,741 --> 07:25:07,590
He knows every way
you're going to come for him.

4521
07:25:07,625 --> 07:25:10,794
The other one is a professional
criminal, escaped prison twice,

4522
07:25:10,829 --> 07:25:13,585
spent half his life on the
run avoiding folks like you.

4523
07:25:13,620 --> 07:25:16,342
Well, if there's anything
we can do to help the DSS...

4524
07:25:16,377 --> 07:25:18,434
Two things. One, I need a translator.

4525
07:25:18,469 --> 07:25:20,054
We have plenty in the
public relations department.

4526
07:25:20,089 --> 07:25:21,931
Elena Neves.

4527
07:25:23,516 --> 07:25:24,892
A patrol officer? You heard me.

4528
07:25:25,685 --> 07:25:27,853
But why? We have many more experienced people.

4529
07:25:27,888 --> 07:25:29,904
I like her smile.

4530
07:25:29,939 --> 07:25:31,941
What's the second thing?

4531
07:25:33,193 --> 07:25:35,903
Stay the fuck out of my way.

4532
07:25:46,247 --> 07:25:47,790
Brian. Hm?

4533
07:25:49,250 --> 07:25:50,668
I have something I have to tell you.

4534
07:25:50,703 --> 07:25:52,419
God damn.

4535
07:25:53,213 --> 07:25:54,296
What a mess.

4536
07:25:56,091 --> 07:25:57,758
Where you been, man?

4537
07:26:00,512 --> 07:26:02,353
You better check that tone.

4538
07:26:02,388 --> 07:26:04,306
And you just better answer the goddamn question.

4539
07:26:04,341 --> 07:26:05,891
Stop it. Both of you.

4540
07:26:09,312 --> 07:26:10,354
Where were you, Vince?

4541
07:26:11,648 --> 07:26:14,531
Guys all over the favelas asking about you.

4542
07:26:14,566 --> 07:26:17,277
Couldn't get out of there without
leading them straight to you.

4543
07:26:17,312 --> 07:26:18,775
Had to wait them out.

4544
07:26:18,810 --> 07:26:20,204
That is such horseshit.

4545
07:26:20,239 --> 07:26:22,408
That was your job,
and those were your guys. Hey.

4546
07:26:22,443 --> 07:26:24,041
Hey. Enough, O'Conner.

4547
07:26:24,076 --> 07:26:25,953
If he said he didn't do it, he didn't do it.

4548
07:26:25,988 --> 07:26:27,121
Go walk it off.

4549
07:26:42,262 --> 07:26:45,806
Look, I would love to expand
my operations into your countries

4550
07:26:46,141 --> 07:26:49,893
but, quite frankly, your business
methods are too violent.

4551
07:26:50,979 --> 07:26:53,230
Let me tell you a true story.

4552
07:26:53,440 --> 07:26:57,735
Five hundred years ago, the Portuguese
and the Spanish came here,

4553
07:26:57,770 --> 07:27:01,280
each trying to get the country
from their natives.

4554
07:27:03,533 --> 07:27:07,995
The Spaniards arrived, guns blazing,
determined to prove who was boss.

4555
07:27:10,331 --> 07:27:13,625
The natives killed every single Spaniard.

4556
07:27:15,503 --> 07:27:19,465
Personally,
I prefer the methods of the Portuguese.

4557
07:27:21,134 --> 07:27:23,114
They came bearing gifts.

4558
07:27:23,149 --> 07:27:25,095
Mirrors, scissors, trinkets.

4559
07:27:25,972 --> 07:27:29,606
Things that the natives
couldn't get on their own,

4560
07:27:29,641 --> 07:27:32,978
but to continue receiving them, they
had to work for the Portuguese.

4561
07:27:34,147 --> 07:27:37,524
And that's why all Brazilians
speak Portuguese today.

4562
07:27:38,359 --> 07:27:42,071
Now, if you dominate the people with violence,

4563
07:27:42,989 --> 07:27:46,408
they will eventually fight back because
they have nothing to lose.

4564
07:27:47,035 --> 07:27:49,084
And that's the key.

4565
07:27:49,119 --> 07:27:52,998
I go into the favelas and give them
something to lose.

4566
07:27:54,000 --> 07:27:56,022
Electricity, running water,

4567
07:27:56,057 --> 07:27:58,045
school rooms for their kids.

4568
07:27:59,631 --> 07:28:02,508
And for that taste of a better life,

4569
07:28:04,052 --> 07:28:06,011
I own them.

4570
07:28:07,180 --> 07:28:08,222
Gentlemen.

4571
07:28:12,894 --> 07:28:14,061
I apologize for the interruption.

4572
07:28:14,604 --> 07:28:17,147
Senor Reyes, may I speak with you?

4573
07:28:17,182 --> 07:28:19,733
We have found them.

4574
07:28:21,194 --> 07:28:23,403
Pardon me, gentlemen.

4575
07:28:38,378 --> 07:28:40,546
Almost wish I didn't see that.

4576
07:28:43,883 --> 07:28:45,905
Almost.

4577
07:28:45,940 --> 07:28:47,928
Wait, Dom.

4578
07:28:48,555 --> 07:28:50,180
Mia was on that train.

4579
07:28:50,215 --> 07:28:51,890
My sister.

4580
07:28:52,600 --> 07:28:55,144
I didn't know.
I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

4581
07:28:55,179 --> 07:28:57,563
You set up the deal.

4582
07:28:58,022 --> 07:29:00,274
I thought the job was for the cars.

4583
07:29:00,733 --> 07:29:02,449
I didn't know.

4584
07:29:02,484 --> 07:29:04,027
All they want is the chip.

4585
07:29:06,030 --> 07:29:07,739
Damn.

4586
07:29:08,408 --> 07:29:10,055
You should have come clean.

4587
07:29:10,090 --> 07:29:11,702
What's going on out here?

4588
07:29:12,412 --> 07:29:13,752
Nothing.

4589
07:29:13,787 --> 07:29:17,332
Please, Dom, just let me have the
chip. I can take this to them.

4590
07:29:17,584 --> 07:29:19,585
They will give it to
Reyes and set things right.

4591
07:29:20,587 --> 07:29:21,670
Get out.

4592
07:29:24,924 --> 07:29:26,300
What?

4593
07:29:26,335 --> 07:29:27,676
Get out.

4594
07:29:35,268 --> 07:29:37,818
You never listen to me.

4595
07:29:37,853 --> 07:29:41,607
Not when I told you he was a cop,
and not now.

4596
07:29:42,609 --> 07:29:46,403
You never trust me and
look where it's gotten us.

4597
07:29:47,030 --> 07:29:48,780
Look at our family now.

4598
07:29:49,282 --> 07:29:53,911
I can't go home.
Your sister is stuck in this life.

4599
07:29:54,787 --> 07:29:55,954
Where's Letty, Dom?

4600
07:29:58,458 --> 07:29:59,458
Where's Letty?

4601
07:30:23,942 --> 07:30:25,365
Plasma cutter.

4602
07:30:25,400 --> 07:30:28,737
Wilkes, I want a list of every
place within 50 miles

4603
07:30:28,772 --> 07:30:30,572
that distributes compressed gas tanks.

4604
07:30:30,607 --> 07:30:32,783
Pass me that manifest.

4605
07:30:39,415 --> 07:30:41,458
Officer Neves. Been waiting for you.

4606
07:30:41,751 --> 07:30:43,919
You asked for me? I did.

4607
07:30:44,170 --> 07:30:45,671
May I ask why?

4608
07:30:46,756 --> 07:30:48,173
My smile is not that great.

4609
07:30:51,678 --> 07:30:54,304
Your husband was an officer who
was gunned down in the favela.

4610
07:30:54,339 --> 07:30:56,265
Six months later,
you upped and joined the force.

4611
07:30:56,300 --> 07:30:57,599
You're motivated.

4612
07:30:58,476 --> 07:31:01,436
Plus, I figure you're the only one
in Rio who can't be bought.

4613
07:31:01,471 --> 07:31:02,938
Am I right?

4614
07:31:04,232 --> 07:31:05,920
Yes. Of course I am.

4615
07:31:05,955 --> 07:31:07,574
Good news, bad news.

4616
07:31:07,609 --> 07:31:09,326
You know I like my dessert first.

4617
07:31:09,361 --> 07:31:11,370
Back-checked the rail line like you asked.

4618
07:31:11,405 --> 07:31:13,490
Found a couple of spots
where they unloaded the cars.

4619
07:31:13,825 --> 07:31:15,249
One set of tracks headed west

4620
07:31:15,284 --> 07:31:18,036
until it hit the main highway,
then disappeared.

4621
07:31:18,071 --> 07:31:19,378
But another set of tracks headed east.

4622
07:31:19,413 --> 07:31:21,873
A 107-inch wheelbase,
eight-and-a-half-inch tread.

4623
07:31:22,333 --> 07:31:24,543
The GT40 that was missing from the manifest.

4624
07:31:24,578 --> 07:31:26,211
Followed the trail a couple of miles.

4625
07:31:26,246 --> 07:31:27,504
Pretty easy in this scrub.

4626
07:31:27,797 --> 07:31:29,339
Can't move without leaving a sign.

4627
07:31:29,374 --> 07:31:30,847
Give me the damn veggies.

4628
07:31:30,882 --> 07:31:34,261
The ground rolls into a hardpack
and we lost that track, too.

4629
07:31:35,596 --> 07:31:37,097
Not necessarily.

4630
07:31:37,598 --> 07:31:40,309
That road heads up through the
hills into the favelas.

4631
07:31:40,344 --> 07:31:43,020
Couple of years ago,
it was washed out by a storm.

4632
07:31:43,396 --> 07:31:45,445
It's all dirt a mile from where you were.

4633
07:31:45,480 --> 07:31:48,734
If they headed that way, we will
pick up their tracks there.

4634
07:31:48,769 --> 07:31:50,690
You come prepared.

4635
07:31:50,725 --> 07:31:52,612
I am motivated.

4636
07:31:53,323 --> 07:31:54,364
All right, then.

4637
07:31:55,074 --> 07:31:57,159
Let's find ourselves a car.

4638
07:32:27,774 --> 07:32:28,780
What do you think?

4639
07:32:28,815 --> 07:32:31,318
Well, it's definitely a custom chip.

4640
07:32:31,903 --> 07:32:35,030
Look at all these side menus
here for data entry.

4641
07:32:35,065 --> 07:32:36,948
Let's check this one.

4642
07:32:41,662 --> 07:32:43,045
Look at that.

4643
07:32:43,080 --> 07:32:45,582
Same building, same order every week.

4644
07:32:45,617 --> 07:32:47,501
It's a delivery schedule.

4645
07:33:08,648 --> 07:33:09,648
What's this?

4646
07:33:11,067 --> 07:33:12,032
Drugs?

4647
07:33:12,067 --> 07:33:15,035
No. That's a dealer pack.

4648
07:33:15,070 --> 07:33:17,072
See, most major players,
they weigh their money

4649
07:33:17,107 --> 07:33:19,032
so they don't have to constantly count it.

4650
07:33:19,067 --> 07:33:20,415
Right there, that's 49 kilos.

4651
07:33:20,450 --> 07:33:22,494
49 kilos is a million in twenties.

4652
07:33:23,162 --> 07:33:25,664
You're saying each one of these shipments
is worth 10 million dollars?

4653
07:33:25,699 --> 07:33:26,790
Yeah.

4654
07:33:49,814 --> 07:33:51,690
I thought so.

4655
07:33:54,110 --> 07:33:55,700
So what is that?

4656
07:33:55,735 --> 07:33:58,071
A 100-million plus in cash houses?

4657
07:33:58,106 --> 07:34:00,407
That's how he keeps it off the grid.

4658
07:34:03,035 --> 07:34:05,704
I think it's safe to say that Reyes
is smart to want this back.

4659
07:34:05,739 --> 07:34:08,373
It's his whole network right there,
just laid out on a chip.

4660
07:34:31,898 --> 07:34:33,231
Wilkes, Fusco, up the middle.

4661
07:34:33,266 --> 07:34:34,983
Mac, Chato, flank north.

4662
07:34:35,018 --> 07:34:36,418
What about me?

4663
07:34:36,453 --> 07:34:37,819
Stay here.

4664
07:34:48,080 --> 07:34:49,087
Go that way.

4665
07:34:49,122 --> 07:34:50,582
The other two went over the wall.

4666
07:35:33,960 --> 07:35:35,043
Come on, go. Go.

4667
07:36:33,311 --> 07:36:34,978
Get on the ground.

4668
07:36:35,813 --> 07:36:38,064
I got Toretto. Four blocks north of your...

4669
07:36:43,571 --> 07:36:45,363
They already know who you are.

4670
07:37:17,355 --> 07:37:18,772
Let's go.

4671
07:38:04,235 --> 07:38:05,617
You okay here?

4672
07:38:05,652 --> 07:38:09,406
Yeah. I am good. Thank you.

4673
07:38:44,150 --> 07:38:46,943
They're going to be looking for
the three of us together now.

4674
07:38:46,978 --> 07:38:49,703
We need to split up.

4675
07:38:49,738 --> 07:38:52,657
You and Mia head south,
I will lead them away.

4676
07:38:52,692 --> 07:38:53,742
No.

4677
07:38:54,577 --> 07:38:56,084
Dom is right.

4678
07:38:56,119 --> 07:38:57,912
Look how lucky we just got.
What happens next time?

4679
07:38:57,947 --> 07:38:59,038
We have no choice but to split up.

4680
07:38:59,073 --> 07:39:00,373
I am pregnant.

4681
07:39:05,212 --> 07:39:06,713
I already lost my family once.

4682
07:39:08,799 --> 07:39:11,342
I am not going through that again.

4683
07:39:11,802 --> 07:39:14,012
Are you kidding me? No.

4684
07:39:19,268 --> 07:39:21,895
I am not going anywhere. Okay?

4685
07:39:24,273 --> 07:39:25,356
Dom?

4686
07:39:26,358 --> 07:39:28,401
Promise me we stick together.

4687
07:39:36,160 --> 07:39:38,036
I promise.

4688
07:39:42,625 --> 07:39:45,084
Our family just got bigger.

4689
07:40:03,187 --> 07:40:04,938
Something doesn't add up.

4690
07:40:05,397 --> 07:40:06,898
Toretto and O'Conner.

4691
07:40:07,399 --> 07:40:11,986
They stay when they're supposed to run,
they steal gas then give it away?

4692
07:40:12,021 --> 07:40:13,696
Now they're killing federal agents?

4693
07:40:15,032 --> 07:40:16,700
It doesn't make any sense.

4694
07:40:16,735 --> 07:40:18,368
Here's what makes sense.

4695
07:40:23,040 --> 07:40:24,624
All these guys are is names on a list.

4696
07:40:24,659 --> 07:40:26,090
They come up, we take them down.

4697
07:40:26,125 --> 07:40:28,711
Not a phone call more, not a bullet less.

4698
07:40:28,746 --> 07:40:30,505
Wilkes, we get anything?

4699
07:40:30,881 --> 07:40:32,222
Standard forensics.

4700
07:40:32,257 --> 07:40:33,800
Shoe prints. Hair and fiber.

4701
07:40:33,835 --> 07:40:35,343
Prints are all over the car.

4702
07:40:35,378 --> 07:40:36,476
Anything else?

4703
07:40:36,511 --> 07:40:38,471
Yeah,
we tracked the owner off the vehicle ID.

4704
07:40:38,506 --> 07:40:40,741
There are a couple of shell
companies in between,

4705
07:40:40,776 --> 07:40:43,252
but we finally traced it back
to a corporation

4706
07:40:43,287 --> 07:40:45,728
owned by an investor
down here named Hernan Reyes.

4707
07:40:45,763 --> 07:40:46,813
Investor?

4708
07:40:48,023 --> 07:40:51,276
If there's anything illegal happening
in Rio, Reyes is involved.

4709
07:40:51,311 --> 07:40:52,951
Okay, then so are we.

4710
07:40:52,986 --> 07:40:55,280
If he could get us any closer to our
guys, I want everything on him.

4711
07:40:55,315 --> 07:40:56,663
Chato, you're on the roof.

4712
07:40:56,698 --> 07:40:59,075
I want you on overwatch in case somebody
comes back for something.

4713
07:40:59,110 --> 07:41:01,501
Mac, give me a cross-check on Reyes,
full specs.

4714
07:41:01,536 --> 07:41:03,830
If he goes to the john, I want to know
how many times he shakes it.

4715
07:41:03,865 --> 07:41:06,291
You got it, boss. Wilkes, Fusco.

4716
07:41:07,001 --> 07:41:08,877
Let's put all this mess back together.

4717
07:41:11,255 --> 07:41:12,756
That's going to take a while.

4718
07:41:12,791 --> 07:41:14,257
Then you better get started.

4719
07:41:14,675 --> 07:41:16,224
They were taking this car apart for a reason.

4720
07:41:16,259 --> 07:41:18,136
Let's put it back together
and find out what's missing.

4721
07:41:45,831 --> 07:41:49,167
Hey, Dom,
what do you remember about your father?

4722
07:41:51,629 --> 07:41:53,338
My father.

4723
07:41:57,509 --> 07:41:59,761
He used to...

4724
07:42:00,429 --> 07:42:03,806
He used to have a barbecue
every Sunday after church.

4725
07:42:04,475 --> 07:42:06,851
For anybody in the neighborhood.

4726
07:42:07,770 --> 07:42:10,146
If you didn't go to church,
you didn't get any barbecue.

4727
07:42:11,982 --> 07:42:15,742
Every single day he was in the
shop, and every single night,

4728
07:42:15,777 --> 07:42:20,865
he was at the kitchen table with Mia,
helping her with her homework.

4729
07:42:22,284 --> 07:42:25,161
Even after she went to sleep,

4730
07:42:25,196 --> 07:42:28,004
he'd stay up for a few more hours

4731
07:42:28,039 --> 07:42:32,085
so he could learn the next chapter
and help her the next day.

4732
07:42:33,337 --> 07:42:35,046
I remember everything about my father.

4733
07:42:36,632 --> 07:42:37,924
Everything.

4734
07:42:39,051 --> 07:42:40,385
That's just it.

4735
07:42:40,761 --> 07:42:42,261
I don't remember shit about my dad.

4736
07:42:45,975 --> 07:42:47,476
I don't remember him yelling.

4737
07:42:47,511 --> 07:42:48,977
I don't remember him smiling.

4738
07:42:51,021 --> 07:42:53,564
To be honest with you, I don't even
remember what the hell he looked like.

4739
07:42:55,734 --> 07:42:57,860
I don't remember. He just...

4740
07:42:59,697 --> 07:43:01,072
He was just never there.

4741
07:43:03,283 --> 07:43:05,410
You ain't going to be like that, Brian.

4742
07:43:22,052 --> 07:43:24,178
We can't keep running, Dom.

4743
07:43:25,848 --> 07:43:27,661
We got to get out.

4744
07:43:27,696 --> 07:43:29,475
We got to get out now.

4745
07:43:30,686 --> 07:43:32,020
You're right.

4746
07:43:43,615 --> 07:43:45,283
Here's how we're going to do it.

4747
07:43:49,496 --> 07:43:50,705
We're going to use this.

4748
07:43:51,874 --> 07:43:53,708
We're going do one last job.

4749
07:43:54,209 --> 07:43:56,502
We're going to take all of Reyes' money.

4750
07:43:56,795 --> 07:43:58,379
Every dime of it,

4751
07:43:59,298 --> 07:44:00,965
and disappear.

4752
07:44:04,595 --> 07:44:05,595
Forever.

4753
07:44:07,139 --> 07:44:08,271
New passports.

4754
07:44:08,306 --> 07:44:10,808
New lives with no more
looking over our shoulder.

4755
07:44:10,843 --> 07:44:12,560
And we're just going to buy our freedom.

4756
07:44:12,595 --> 07:44:13,651
That's right.

4757
07:44:13,686 --> 07:44:15,354
You realize we're talking
about going up against

4758
07:44:15,389 --> 07:44:16,773
the most powerful guy in all of Rio?

4759
07:44:17,066 --> 07:44:18,524
Yes, we are.

4760
07:44:19,943 --> 07:44:21,861
Then we're going to need a team.

4761
07:44:28,452 --> 07:44:30,828
Let's run through the bases real quick.
Who do we got?

4762
07:44:30,863 --> 07:44:32,288
First we're going to need a chameleon.

4763
07:44:33,791 --> 07:44:37,668
Someone who can blend in anywhere.

4764
07:44:38,712 --> 07:44:39,775
What else?

4765
07:44:39,810 --> 07:44:40,838
A fast talker.

4766
07:44:41,757 --> 07:44:44,258
Someone who can bullshit their
way out of anything.

4767
07:44:44,676 --> 07:44:45,676
I got that.

4768
07:44:47,513 --> 07:44:49,062
This guy is going to have
a lot of surveillance.

4769
07:44:49,097 --> 07:44:50,890
We're going to need someone
who's good with circuits.

4770
07:44:53,060 --> 07:44:55,562
And with those circuits,
Reyes is going to have walls.

4771
07:44:55,597 --> 07:44:58,064
We're going to need guys to
punch through those walls.

4772
07:45:00,025 --> 07:45:01,067
What else?

4773
07:45:01,610 --> 07:45:03,326
Utilities and weapons.

4774
07:45:03,361 --> 07:45:06,197
Someone who ain't afraid to throw down.

4775
07:45:07,116 --> 07:45:09,117
Someone to back up every position.

4776
07:45:09,152 --> 07:45:10,743
Yeah, what else do we need?

4777
07:45:10,778 --> 07:45:12,453
Most importantly,

4778
07:45:13,539 --> 07:45:15,748
we're going to need two precision drivers.

4779
07:45:15,783 --> 07:45:18,459
Guys that don't crack under pressure.

4780
07:45:18,494 --> 07:45:20,002
Guys that never lose.

4781
07:45:21,296 --> 07:45:22,588
You know we got that.

4782
07:45:50,492 --> 07:45:52,493
Aw, hell, no.

4783
07:45:53,453 --> 07:45:56,164
I see they really scraped the bottom
of the barrel, huh?

4784
07:45:56,199 --> 07:45:58,541
I guess they did, since your ass is here.

4785
07:46:00,294 --> 07:46:03,337
When are you going to give Martin
Luther King his car back?

4786
07:46:03,372 --> 07:46:06,174
As soon as you give Rick
James his jacket back.

4787
07:46:09,428 --> 07:46:11,554
What's up, man? What's up?

4788
07:46:22,816 --> 07:46:23,816
Hmm.

4789
07:46:24,568 --> 07:46:26,298
Sexy legs, baby girl.

4790
07:46:26,333 --> 07:46:28,029
What time do they open?

4791
07:46:28,906 --> 07:46:32,700
They open the same time
as I pull this trigger.

4792
07:46:33,243 --> 07:46:34,702
Want me to open them?

4793
07:46:38,081 --> 07:46:40,923
I told you the skinny chick had balls.

4794
07:46:40,958 --> 07:46:43,586
Looks like she started the party without us.

4795
07:46:44,171 --> 07:46:46,797
Hey, anybody can talk shit in Spanish, homie.

4796
07:46:47,382 --> 07:46:49,717
What's this guy saying?

4797
07:46:50,427 --> 07:46:52,345
Ugly is still ugly in Spanish or in English.

4798
07:46:55,641 --> 07:46:57,725
Who are these clowns, man? Circus clowns.

4799
07:46:59,853 --> 07:47:02,855
I thought cockfights were illegal in Brazil.

4800
07:47:02,890 --> 07:47:05,024
I see you all have met.

4801
07:47:06,735 --> 07:47:08,784
You know when you called me to come to Rio

4802
07:47:08,819 --> 07:47:11,739
I assumed it would be for something
more exciting than this.

4803
07:47:11,774 --> 07:47:12,788
Look at this guy.

4804
07:47:12,823 --> 07:47:15,034
Long time. I missed you, man.

4805
07:47:15,069 --> 07:47:16,636
Good to see you.

4806
07:47:16,671 --> 07:47:18,169
Brother. What's up?

4807
07:47:18,204 --> 07:47:20,289
Yo, check this out. This is Tej.

4808
07:47:20,324 --> 07:47:22,142
Best circuit man on the East Coast.

4809
07:47:22,177 --> 07:47:23,960
And this is my boy, Roman Pearce.

4810
07:47:24,294 --> 07:47:26,275
We go way back, I met this guy in juvie.

4811
07:47:26,310 --> 07:47:28,256
I pulled that job with him in Miami.

4812
07:47:28,291 --> 07:47:29,757
I have heard about you.

4813
07:47:30,926 --> 07:47:32,391
Nice digs.

4814
07:47:32,426 --> 07:47:34,303
Yeah, well, the Ritz was sold out.

4815
07:47:34,846 --> 07:47:36,562
So what's this all about, Dom?

4816
07:47:36,597 --> 07:47:40,017
Yeah, man, why did you drag
us halfway around the world?

4817
07:47:40,052 --> 07:47:41,894
Because we got a job.

4818
07:47:42,896 --> 07:47:45,523
All right,
so our target's name is Hernan Reyes.

4819
07:47:45,558 --> 07:47:47,281
And he runs the drug scene down here.

4820
07:47:47,316 --> 07:47:49,944
He's never been busted because
he doesn't leave a paper trail.

4821
07:47:49,979 --> 07:47:52,109
No paper trail means no banks.

4822
07:47:52,144 --> 07:47:54,205
And no banks means cash houses.

4823
07:47:54,240 --> 07:47:56,742
That's right. Ten of them, to be exact.

4824
07:47:56,777 --> 07:47:58,960
Spread throughout the city.

4825
07:47:58,995 --> 07:48:00,913
And we're going to hit them all.

4826
07:48:02,374 --> 07:48:03,374
All of them?

4827
07:48:03,792 --> 07:48:04,840
All of them.

4828
07:48:04,875 --> 07:48:06,842
That sounds crazy.

4829
07:48:06,877 --> 07:48:08,962
You bring us to a whole other country

4830
07:48:08,997 --> 07:48:11,048
so we can rob the dude who runs it?

4831
07:48:12,175 --> 07:48:13,801
I thought this was business.

4832
07:48:14,094 --> 07:48:15,386
Sounds personal to me.

4833
07:48:16,305 --> 07:48:17,895
Is that what this is?

4834
07:48:17,930 --> 07:48:21,809
I got love for you all,
but personal ain't good business.

4835
07:48:23,437 --> 07:48:25,688
I can't do this, homie.

4836
07:48:26,940 --> 07:48:31,068
So what we're talking about is $100 million.

4837
07:48:31,103 --> 07:48:33,160
You say what?

4838
07:48:33,195 --> 07:48:36,872
Hundred...
See, sometimes I be over thinking, man,

4839
07:48:36,907 --> 07:48:40,036
and I know we just met, but
you just, kind of, got to...

4840
07:48:40,071 --> 07:48:43,873
That's right, $100 million,
and everything we take,

4841
07:48:43,908 --> 07:48:45,339
we split even.

4842
07:48:45,374 --> 07:48:47,251
That's a little over $11 million apiece.

4843
07:48:48,253 --> 07:48:49,628
I am down.

4844
07:48:50,088 --> 07:48:51,130
I am in.

4845
07:48:52,758 --> 07:48:54,175
Eleven million.

4846
07:48:54,593 --> 07:48:57,303
Sounds like a whole lot of
vaginal activity to me.

4847
07:48:57,763 --> 07:49:00,056
You can't pull off 10 heists
on the same mark.

4848
07:49:00,091 --> 07:49:01,188
You just can't.

4849
07:49:01,223 --> 07:49:02,815
As soon as we hit the first one,

4850
07:49:02,850 --> 07:49:05,686
they're going to do everything
they can to protect the rest.

4851
07:49:06,688 --> 07:49:08,439
Exactly.

4852
07:49:47,020 --> 07:49:48,145
Nobody move.

4853
07:50:03,328 --> 07:50:04,579
That's all of it.

4854
07:50:04,614 --> 07:50:05,795
You a dead man.

4855
07:50:05,830 --> 07:50:06,997
You're all dead men.

4856
07:50:07,833 --> 07:50:09,333
You don't have a place to hide.

4857
07:50:12,295 --> 07:50:13,504
Who's hiding?

4858
07:50:13,539 --> 07:50:15,971
Are you crazy?

4859
07:50:16,006 --> 07:50:18,968
Do you know whose house this is?
Whose money are you stealing?

4860
07:50:29,438 --> 07:50:30,855
We ain't stealing it.

4861
07:50:39,781 --> 07:50:42,867
You tell your boss exactly who did this.

4862
07:50:44,494 --> 07:50:45,995
Tell him there's more coming.

4863
07:50:51,668 --> 07:50:52,668
Voila.

4864
07:50:53,628 --> 07:50:54,628
Turn it over.

4865
07:51:00,802 --> 07:51:04,013
She's running on all eight.
Checks out fine.

4866
07:51:06,558 --> 07:51:08,476
Keep looking.

4867
07:51:10,520 --> 07:51:14,064
Boss, if something was missing, we'd know.

4868
07:51:39,674 --> 07:51:43,344
It's a goddamn shame putting
bullshit like that on a classic.

4869
07:51:43,720 --> 07:51:45,763
You may as well slap neon lights on it.

4870
07:51:57,025 --> 07:51:58,991
They took the chip.

4871
07:51:59,026 --> 07:52:02,863
We got a hit on the police scanner.
Armed robbery at a house in Leblon.

4872
07:52:02,898 --> 07:52:04,330
Address cross-checks against property

4873
07:52:04,365 --> 07:52:06,116
owned by one of Hernan Reyes' corporations.

4874
07:52:06,151 --> 07:52:07,333
All right, if that's our guys

4875
07:52:07,368 --> 07:52:10,037
then whatever was on that chip
led them directly to that house.

4876
07:52:10,072 --> 07:52:11,389
It's them, for sure.

4877
07:52:11,424 --> 07:52:12,671
How do you know that?

4878
07:52:12,706 --> 07:52:17,086
Because no one else in Rio is
stupid enough to rob Reyes.

4879
07:52:30,809 --> 07:52:31,857
Explain.

4880
07:52:31,892 --> 07:52:33,644
They invaded the Leblon house.

4881
07:52:34,020 --> 07:52:35,319
Who invaded?

4882
07:52:35,354 --> 07:52:37,815
The men from the train.

4883
07:52:46,157 --> 07:52:48,242
How much did they take?

4884
07:52:48,277 --> 07:52:50,327
They didn't take anything.

4885
07:52:50,362 --> 07:52:54,039
They burned it.

4886
07:52:54,332 --> 07:52:55,881
They burned my money?

4887
07:52:55,916 --> 07:52:59,128
Yes. And said there's more coming.

4888
07:53:07,178 --> 07:53:08,220
Okay...

4889
07:53:16,855 --> 07:53:18,856
Then this...

4890
07:53:20,734 --> 07:53:22,192
...is what we're going to do.

4891
07:53:28,742 --> 07:53:30,367
Clean the houses.

4892
07:53:30,660 --> 07:53:34,872
I want that money under lock and key...

4893
07:53:36,333 --> 07:53:37,416
...within an hour.

4894
07:53:37,451 --> 07:53:39,710
Understand?

4895
07:53:41,921 --> 07:53:43,547
Understood.

4896
07:54:02,525 --> 07:54:04,943
Number one is on the move, man.

4897
07:54:19,334 --> 07:54:20,876
Two is on the move.

4898
07:54:45,610 --> 07:54:46,610
I got mine.

4899
07:55:07,632 --> 07:55:09,633
I got eyes on Five.

4900
07:55:36,327 --> 07:55:39,663
I know you all said they were consolidating
the money somewhere, but,

4901
07:55:39,998 --> 07:55:42,875
you all ain't going to believe this.

4902
07:55:52,594 --> 07:55:55,053
Well, this job just got a lot harder.

4903
07:55:55,722 --> 07:55:57,911
If he's moving it into a police station

4904
07:55:57,946 --> 07:56:00,100
he's got some serious brass in his pocket.

4905
07:56:01,269 --> 07:56:02,770
Looks like this is going to be a
shorter trip than I thought...

4906
07:56:02,805 --> 07:56:05,227
Hell, yeah, we can't do this.

4907
07:56:05,262 --> 07:56:07,649
"Can't?" You mean, "shouldn't. "

4908
07:56:08,610 --> 07:56:10,694
I think this doesn't change a thing.

4909
07:56:13,782 --> 07:56:16,116
I say we stick to the plan.

4910
07:56:16,151 --> 07:56:17,833
You say what?

4911
07:56:17,868 --> 07:56:19,620
This just went from Mission: Impossible

4912
07:56:19,655 --> 07:56:21,580
to Mission: In-freaking-sanity.

4913
07:56:23,792 --> 07:56:25,007
Whatever, man.

4914
07:56:25,042 --> 07:56:28,504
I ain't scared, I am just letting you
all know, going in that building is crazy.

4915
07:56:28,539 --> 07:56:30,005
I got this.

4916
07:56:33,635 --> 07:56:34,968
What time was the robbery?

4917
07:56:35,003 --> 07:56:36,887
Around 11:00.

4918
07:56:38,431 --> 07:56:39,640
Here we go.

4919
07:56:41,810 --> 07:56:43,310
Enhance it.

4920
07:56:45,438 --> 07:56:46,855
Their faces are covered.

4921
07:56:46,890 --> 07:56:48,065
Run it through FRS.

4922
07:56:54,155 --> 07:56:55,781
Well, hello, you son of a bitch.

4923
07:56:58,660 --> 07:57:01,703
Wilkes. Run the photos of known associates
of Toretto and O'Conner

4924
07:57:01,738 --> 07:57:04,630
against customs entries into
Brazil in the last two weeks.

4925
07:57:04,665 --> 07:57:07,918
Check planes, trains, boats, everything
short of the goddamn space shuttle.

4926
07:57:14,259 --> 07:57:17,344
They can change their names but
they can't change their faces.

4927
07:57:17,379 --> 07:57:19,179
Something big is going down.

4928
07:57:20,932 --> 07:57:22,314
That's a 1970 Charger.

4929
07:57:22,349 --> 07:57:24,483
Fusco. Upload these specs into the database.

4930
07:57:24,518 --> 07:57:26,895
Have the computer cross-check
it with overhead satellites

4931
07:57:26,930 --> 07:57:28,946
every 15 minutes, the van behind it, too.

4932
07:57:28,981 --> 07:57:31,817
If these vehicles move in the streets
of Rio, I want to know about it.

4933
07:57:40,702 --> 07:57:41,765
Everything okay?

4934
07:57:41,800 --> 07:57:42,793
Everything is okay.

4935
07:57:42,828 --> 07:57:45,581
Who is this Hobbs? This Federal
Agent running around town?

4936
07:57:45,832 --> 07:57:46,832
Some American cowboy.

4937
07:57:47,584 --> 07:57:48,584
He's handled.

4938
07:57:48,835 --> 07:57:50,294
He killed sixteen of our men.

4939
07:57:51,004 --> 07:57:52,177
Handle him better.

4940
07:57:52,212 --> 07:57:57,676
Look... He requested a rookie
patrol officer as his assistant.

4941
07:58:00,430 --> 07:58:01,430
They won't be a problem.

4942
07:58:30,418 --> 07:58:32,336
It's all here? Yes.

4943
07:58:33,838 --> 07:58:35,589
What about Toretto and O'Conner?
Where are they?

4944
07:58:36,049 --> 07:58:37,049
Nothing yet.

4945
07:58:38,092 --> 07:58:39,927
But I have all our officers searching.

4946
07:58:40,762 --> 07:58:41,887
Not good enough.

4947
07:58:42,764 --> 07:58:44,181
Put a price on their heads.

4948
07:58:44,216 --> 07:58:45,766
High enough...

4949
07:58:46,351 --> 07:58:48,477
...to get every pair of eyes in
the city searching for them.

4950
07:58:55,944 --> 07:58:58,445
The beauty of public offices?

4951
07:59:01,366 --> 07:59:02,366
Public records.

4952
07:59:02,784 --> 07:59:05,202
This is where he's keeping the money.
The vault in the evidence room.

4953
07:59:06,287 --> 07:59:10,624
Um. Uh, yeah. Can I get everyone's
attention, right here, for a second?

4954
07:59:10,659 --> 07:59:14,378
We're talking about breaking
into a police station.

4955
07:59:14,413 --> 07:59:16,171
Is anyone listening to those words?

4956
07:59:16,206 --> 07:59:17,763
Anybody? Popo?

4957
07:59:17,798 --> 07:59:19,820
Five-O. One-time. Pigs.

4958
07:59:19,855 --> 07:59:21,808
People we don't like.

4959
07:59:21,843 --> 07:59:24,846
You know, police stations are designed
to keep people in, not out.

4960
07:59:24,881 --> 07:59:26,223
That's why it's a stealth mission.

4961
07:59:26,641 --> 07:59:29,351
We will be in and out before they
even know we were there.

4962
07:59:29,386 --> 07:59:30,943
Well, we will need to get eyes in there.

4963
07:59:30,978 --> 07:59:33,522
At least to find out the make
and model of that vault.

4964
07:59:33,773 --> 07:59:37,109
So the vault and then, so...

4965
07:59:37,144 --> 07:59:38,617
It's crazy.

4966
07:59:38,652 --> 07:59:41,571
Who's supposed to do all this?

4967
07:59:49,998 --> 07:59:51,915
What do you mean?

4968
07:59:53,126 --> 07:59:54,132
Why me?

4969
07:59:54,167 --> 07:59:56,169
Because you got the biggest mouth.

4970
07:59:56,204 --> 07:59:58,255
That's for damn sure.

4971
08:00:04,971 --> 08:00:05,971
Ooh.

4972
08:00:07,765 --> 08:00:09,314
Hello, beautiful.

4973
08:00:09,349 --> 08:00:12,025
Look at those dimples. Sexy, sexy.

4974
08:00:12,060 --> 08:00:14,187
Love those glasses.
Where did you get them from?

4975
08:00:14,222 --> 08:00:16,690
Are those like Gucci frames or something?

4976
08:00:16,725 --> 08:00:17,906
No English?

4977
08:00:17,941 --> 08:00:20,819
No, no, no. Damn.

4978
08:00:21,362 --> 08:00:22,446
How are you, sir?

4979
08:00:22,864 --> 08:00:26,700
Special Agent O'Conner. US Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

4980
08:00:26,735 --> 08:00:27,993
It says Caucasian.

4981
08:00:28,286 --> 08:00:31,038
That's a tan. You know, a tan?

4982
08:00:33,958 --> 08:00:38,003
Look, I am working this case and I got
some evidence here to be held.

4983
08:00:38,038 --> 08:00:40,464
But I need to get in and check
your storage facility first.

4984
08:00:40,499 --> 08:00:41,513
Nope.

4985
08:00:41,548 --> 08:00:44,926
Look, I know you're a true professional,
and I respect you, I promise.

4986
08:00:44,961 --> 08:00:47,179
You know, it looks like you
work out a little bit, too.

4987
08:00:47,214 --> 08:00:49,723
What do you bench, about 350?

4988
08:00:50,141 --> 08:00:51,141
Ah, shit.

4989
08:00:52,310 --> 08:00:53,608
Look, I am just trying to do my job, man.

4990
08:00:53,643 --> 08:00:56,605
My boss sent me here to just make
sure that everything was safe.

4991
08:00:56,640 --> 08:00:57,654
It will be safe.

4992
08:00:57,689 --> 08:00:59,858
Let me just come in and take a quick peek.

4993
08:00:59,893 --> 08:01:00,907
Nope.

4994
08:01:00,942 --> 08:01:03,570
Come on, man. Hook a brother up, please?

4995
08:01:03,605 --> 08:01:05,110
Nope. And you're not my brother.

4996
08:01:05,145 --> 08:01:06,580
Brother from another mother?

4997
08:01:06,615 --> 08:01:09,910
Look. No one enters the facility but
authorized evidence personnel.

4998
08:01:09,945 --> 08:01:11,168
Now stop wasting my time.

4999
08:01:11,203 --> 08:01:12,496
I am going to call the embassy.

5000
08:01:12,531 --> 08:01:13,789
No, no, no. No, we're good.

5001
08:01:14,123 --> 08:01:16,249
We don't need to call them.
For what? We're good.

5002
08:01:16,284 --> 08:01:18,884
Here, I got the box. We're all good.

5003
08:01:18,919 --> 08:01:21,887
I promise you.
Thank you so much for your time.

5004
08:01:21,922 --> 08:01:24,216
Swear to God, if you were on
the other side of that glass

5005
08:01:24,251 --> 08:01:26,676
I'd bust your damn face in.
Now translate that.

5006
08:01:44,529 --> 08:01:48,240
It's done. See, I think I make a better
special agent than you ever did.

5007
08:01:49,992 --> 08:01:52,285
Well, that depends on how you define "special. "

5008
08:01:55,331 --> 08:01:56,623
Come on, now. Let's see what we got.

5009
08:01:56,658 --> 08:01:58,208
Not funny.

5010
08:02:05,550 --> 08:02:07,259
All right, come on.

5011
08:02:12,306 --> 08:02:13,807
Dawg, you still can't drive.

5012
08:02:15,434 --> 08:02:18,436
Now, I see why you're always
getting into accidents.

5013
08:02:18,471 --> 08:02:20,601
You can't even drive a
damn remote control car.

5014
08:02:20,636 --> 08:02:22,732
I am going to need you to shut up right now.

5015
08:02:22,767 --> 08:02:24,585
I am not going to shut up. Shut up.

5016
08:02:24,620 --> 08:02:26,403
Strap him in his safety belt, man.

5017
08:02:29,615 --> 08:02:31,123
Give me the remote, dawg. Go left.

5018
08:02:31,158 --> 08:02:33,368
It looks like something right over
there to the left. What is that?

5019
08:02:33,403 --> 08:02:34,452
What is that?

5020
08:02:35,830 --> 08:02:36,830
Bingo.

5021
08:02:38,082 --> 08:02:40,083
What is that, six-by-six?

5022
08:02:40,118 --> 08:02:41,477
Eight-by-twelve.

5023
08:02:41,512 --> 08:02:42,801
Seven-by-twelve.

5024
08:02:42,836 --> 08:02:46,012
Fitted with 18-inch-thick steel
reinforced walls...

5025
08:02:46,047 --> 08:02:49,676
...with a insulated copper core to
protect against thermal lance.

5026
08:02:49,711 --> 08:02:53,221
A Class-3 electronic lock with
a surefire Griffin retumbler

5027
08:02:53,256 --> 08:02:54,980
and a biometric palm scanner.

5028
08:02:55,015 --> 08:02:57,183
Ten tons of top-of-the-line security.

5029
08:02:57,218 --> 08:02:59,328
Do I want to know how you know all that?

5030
08:02:59,363 --> 08:03:01,359
I had a life before you knew me, O'Conner.

5031
08:03:01,394 --> 08:03:03,356
Let's just leave it at that, all right?

5032
08:03:03,391 --> 08:03:05,108
She is a beauty, though, man.

5033
08:03:05,143 --> 08:03:07,325
A "beauty" as in "good?"

5034
08:03:07,360 --> 08:03:10,162
"Beauty" as in, she's going to
start off playing hard to get.

5035
08:03:10,197 --> 08:03:14,534
Then, no matter how much I caress her,
no matter how much I love her,

5036
08:03:14,569 --> 08:03:17,871
in the end, she still
ain't going to give up that ass.

5037
08:03:24,462 --> 08:03:25,962
Two to one says you blow the wrong pipe.

5038
08:03:26,339 --> 08:03:28,381
Yo, why you got to be so negative
all the time, man?

5039
08:03:29,592 --> 08:03:30,891
I ain't negative.

5040
08:03:30,926 --> 08:03:33,803
I am just positive you're going to mess it up.

5041
08:03:34,180 --> 08:03:37,182
I am telling you, man, you got issues.

5042
08:03:41,979 --> 08:03:45,649
Next time if there's no elevator,
I am not coming.

5043
08:03:46,192 --> 08:03:49,194
You need to learn to relax, loco.

5044
08:04:10,841 --> 08:04:12,884
You better hurry up,
we got less than a minute.

5045
08:04:12,919 --> 08:04:18,932
Why do you always set the timer so short?

5046
08:04:42,373 --> 08:04:43,623
I hope you know where you're going.

5047
08:04:43,658 --> 08:04:46,543
I got this. Relax, man.

5048
08:04:46,578 --> 08:04:47,263
Relax.

5049
08:05:00,766 --> 08:05:02,392
...a police station.

5050
08:05:02,768 --> 08:05:04,185
Relax.

5051
08:05:15,990 --> 08:05:17,824
You used too much explosive. Again.

5052
08:05:18,909 --> 08:05:20,577
Too much, too little...

5053
08:05:21,162 --> 08:05:22,162
It's all the same.

5054
08:05:22,830 --> 08:05:27,667
That's some Buddha shit you learned from
a book in the prison library, isn't it?

5055
08:05:28,836 --> 08:05:30,378
And what you're doing there on the wall...

5056
08:05:30,413 --> 08:05:33,256
You got that from the same book, huh?

5057
08:05:33,758 --> 08:05:34,758
You're so negative, bro.

5058
08:06:01,619 --> 08:06:03,953
Can I have some light?

5059
08:06:07,375 --> 08:06:09,716
Got it. We got it.

5060
08:06:09,751 --> 08:06:11,461
Yeah, we're looking at four cameras.

5061
08:06:11,796 --> 08:06:14,005
Yo, that's some high-end shit, too.

5062
08:06:14,040 --> 08:06:15,131
Marker optics.

5063
08:06:15,674 --> 08:06:17,509
Hundred-degree field-of-view.

5064
08:06:17,802 --> 08:06:19,267
Ten seconds oscillation.

5065
08:06:19,302 --> 08:06:21,353
Yeah, that's a narrow window, man.

5066
08:06:21,388 --> 08:06:23,139
Can't we just tap in and replace the image?

5067
08:06:23,174 --> 08:06:25,242
No, it's hooked into a digital sync.

5068
08:06:25,277 --> 08:06:27,310
They would know we were in the system.

5069
08:06:27,345 --> 08:06:29,402
The best we can do is peek.

5070
08:06:29,437 --> 08:06:32,107
We're going to need some real
fast cars to get through this.

5071
08:06:32,142 --> 08:06:33,650
Not just fast.

5072
08:06:33,943 --> 08:06:35,923
You got a hard right and a hairpin.

5073
08:06:35,958 --> 08:06:37,904
We're going to need something agile.

5074
08:06:37,939 --> 08:06:39,739
You guys mock up a track.

5075
08:06:39,774 --> 08:06:40,824
O'Conner.

5076
08:06:42,159 --> 08:06:43,576
Let's go get some cars.

5077
08:06:44,036 --> 08:06:45,495
Nice.

5078
08:07:24,368 --> 08:07:26,703
Home sweet home.

5079
08:07:44,638 --> 08:07:45,763
Or that.

5080
08:07:46,640 --> 08:07:49,142
How about that?
All motor, no tuning issues.

5081
08:07:49,177 --> 08:07:51,526
I always wanted one of those.

5082
08:07:51,561 --> 08:07:55,231
Held the record on the
Avenida three years running.

5083
08:07:56,650 --> 08:07:57,699
Damn, bro...

5084
08:07:57,734 --> 08:08:00,445
You got a lot of balls to bring
your problems here, Toretto.

5085
08:08:00,821 --> 08:08:03,663
Not to mention a cop.

5086
08:08:03,698 --> 08:08:05,957
Yeah, we can keep that on the low.

5087
08:08:05,992 --> 08:08:09,037
Word on the street is a lot of people
are looking for you two.

5088
08:08:09,997 --> 08:08:10,997
What?

5089
08:08:11,332 --> 08:08:13,041
You didn't think we'd recognize you?

5090
08:08:14,418 --> 08:08:16,419
No, we're kind of counting on it.

5091
08:08:16,837 --> 08:08:19,172
That little coupe may
run the streets around here,

5092
08:08:20,674 --> 08:08:24,719
but that monster has never
seen a set of tail lights.

5093
08:08:25,429 --> 08:08:26,763
Ever. Well, she's about to.

5094
08:08:28,849 --> 08:08:29,974
Dominic Toretto's ride in my garage.

5095
08:08:31,060 --> 08:08:35,230
Now that... will be a nice trophy.

5096
08:08:36,982 --> 08:08:39,567
Let's go, legend.

5097
08:08:40,486 --> 08:08:42,717
Car for car.

5098
08:08:42,752 --> 08:08:44,948
Car for car?

5099
08:08:45,324 --> 08:08:46,824
You want it, come and get it.

5100
08:08:51,539 --> 08:08:53,373
Let's see what they got.

5101
08:08:59,797 --> 08:09:01,005
Really?

5102
08:09:02,675 --> 08:09:05,781
Where did you get that from? Papa Smurf?

5103
08:09:05,816 --> 08:09:08,888
Okay, O'Conner, give it your best shot.

5104
08:09:31,954 --> 08:09:32,996
How was that one?

5105
08:09:33,031 --> 08:09:34,038
Camera caught you.

5106
08:09:34,707 --> 08:09:36,548
What? Yeah, it still caught you.

5107
08:09:36,583 --> 08:09:38,626
Man, I was milking the hell
out of that thing, too.

5108
08:09:39,336 --> 08:09:41,129
We're going to need a faster car.

5109
08:09:45,718 --> 08:09:47,468
I want my money. Come on, man.

5110
08:09:51,181 --> 08:09:52,181
Yeah.

5111
08:09:54,810 --> 08:09:56,686
Let's get it. Watch this.

5112
08:10:03,360 --> 08:10:06,904
That's exactly why your
ass ain't been driving.

5113
08:10:18,459 --> 08:10:20,126
I think I am in love.

5114
08:10:23,922 --> 08:10:25,388
That was real solid work.

5115
08:10:25,423 --> 08:10:28,968
I think Camera 3 still caught you, though.

5116
08:10:29,003 --> 08:10:30,261
Let's do it again.

5117
08:10:37,770 --> 08:10:39,729
That's the piggy bank you ordered.

5118
08:10:39,764 --> 08:10:41,731
You're kidding me. Yep.

5119
08:10:43,609 --> 08:10:46,402
Where in the hell
did you all get one of these?

5120
08:10:47,112 --> 08:10:48,905
Well, we had a life before you met us.

5121
08:10:50,240 --> 08:10:53,576
All right, I will get to work
on the electronic tumbler

5122
08:10:53,611 --> 08:10:55,828
but there's still another problem.

5123
08:10:56,497 --> 08:10:57,795
Palm scanner.

5124
08:10:57,830 --> 08:10:59,707
And without Reyes' handprint,

5125
08:11:00,042 --> 08:11:02,147
Houdini himself couldn't open this bitch.

5126
08:11:02,182 --> 08:11:04,253
How do you know it's Reyes' handprint?

5127
08:11:04,288 --> 08:11:06,054
You got $100 million in a safe.

5128
08:11:06,089 --> 08:11:07,882
You going to put somebody
else's handprint on it?

5129
08:11:08,217 --> 08:11:10,968
Now there you
go with that negativity, man.

5130
08:11:11,003 --> 08:11:12,387
That shit is eating you alive.

5131
08:11:12,422 --> 08:11:13,686
You check that.

5132
08:11:13,721 --> 08:11:15,813
Yo, check that. Shut up.

5133
08:11:15,848 --> 08:11:18,017
How are we supposed to get Reyes' handprint?

5134
08:11:19,311 --> 08:11:20,818
Han.

5135
08:11:20,853 --> 08:11:21,938
You're up.

5136
08:11:23,941 --> 08:11:26,776
Sure. Nothing like the easy stuff.

5137
08:11:27,611 --> 08:11:29,362
Let's go. I will drive.

5138
08:11:47,798 --> 08:11:49,799
I make six bodyguards. Seven.

5139
08:11:50,634 --> 08:11:53,761
You think that guy with a
fanny pack is a tourist?

5140
08:11:58,809 --> 08:12:01,234
So, how long were you in the army?

5141
08:12:01,269 --> 08:12:04,147
That gun you pulled the other
day was a Jericho 941.

5142
08:12:05,482 --> 08:12:07,317
Thumb-racking the slide?

5143
08:12:07,352 --> 08:12:09,152
That was straight-up Mossad.

5144
08:12:10,237 --> 08:12:12,280
I got out of the military

5145
08:12:13,490 --> 08:12:16,451
probably the same time you quit smoking.

5146
08:12:16,486 --> 08:12:18,494
The amount of chips you eat,

5147
08:12:18,954 --> 08:12:22,039
the way you always have to keep
your hands and mouth busy,

5148
08:12:22,074 --> 08:12:24,709
you were a two-pack-a-day man for sure.

5149
08:12:26,795 --> 08:12:28,421
Unfiltered.

5150
08:12:32,092 --> 08:12:33,509
Well, this is a bust.

5151
08:12:34,678 --> 08:12:37,931
We're not going to be able to
get his fingerprints out here.

5152
08:12:37,966 --> 08:12:41,184
We need to do some more recon,
call in a couple of extra guys.

5153
08:12:41,219 --> 08:12:41,684
Or

5154
08:12:42,936 --> 08:12:45,146
you don't send a man to do a woman's job.

5155
08:13:43,413 --> 08:13:46,165
We're going to figure this out,
I promise you.

5156
08:13:49,461 --> 08:13:50,753
What's up?

5157
08:13:51,380 --> 08:13:53,923
I thought you were more of a thong man.

5158
08:13:53,958 --> 08:13:55,341
We got the print.

5159
08:13:56,927 --> 08:13:58,219
Where?

5160
08:14:00,222 --> 08:14:02,181
Okay, that's crazy.

5161
08:14:03,892 --> 08:14:08,396
So, did he just slap that ass or
did he grab and hold on to it?

5162
08:14:10,941 --> 08:14:13,025
Hey, this will work.

5163
08:14:13,652 --> 08:14:15,320
I am impressed.

5164
08:14:15,355 --> 08:14:16,953
Got it?
Got it.

5165
08:14:16,988 --> 08:14:18,781
But you still didn't answer the question.

5166
08:14:24,788 --> 08:14:27,206
Oh, no. Guys, guys.
Guys, we have a problem.

5167
08:14:27,241 --> 08:14:29,542
The whole team just got burnt.

5168
08:14:30,961 --> 08:14:32,795
Now we're all wanted.

5169
08:14:34,965 --> 08:14:35,930
How did this happen?

5170
08:14:35,965 --> 08:14:39,719
US Diplomatic Security Service
issued the warrants.

5171
08:14:39,754 --> 08:14:41,637
Agent L. Hobbs.

5172
08:14:42,014 --> 08:14:43,014
Hold on one second.

5173
08:14:44,141 --> 08:14:45,182
Hey, Dom.

5174
08:14:46,852 --> 08:14:48,644
Is that the guy you saw in the favela?

5175
08:14:51,481 --> 08:14:52,607
Yeah.

5176
08:14:52,983 --> 08:14:56,444
Hobbs is the leader of the elite
task force for the DSS.

5177
08:14:56,479 --> 08:14:57,618
So he's good.

5178
08:14:57,653 --> 08:15:00,823
When the FBI wants to find somebody,
that's who they call.

5179
08:15:00,858 --> 08:15:02,658
Because he never misses his mark.

5180
08:15:02,693 --> 08:15:05,620
This guy is Old Testament.

5181
08:15:05,996 --> 08:15:08,998
Blood, bullets, wrath of God.
That's his style.

5182
08:15:09,374 --> 08:15:11,757
And right now he's hunting us?

5183
08:15:11,792 --> 08:15:13,586
Dom, we got to move up our timeline.

5184
08:15:13,621 --> 08:15:14,760
Yeah, but how?

5185
08:15:14,795 --> 08:15:18,341
This thing's already been difficult
without Wyatt Earp on our asses.

5186
08:15:18,926 --> 08:15:20,676
If anything, we need more room to breathe.

5187
08:15:23,013 --> 08:15:24,388
Roman's right.

5188
08:15:27,225 --> 08:15:29,685
Think we need to get some fresh air.

5189
08:15:33,607 --> 08:15:35,691
We have got a hit. '70s Charger.

5190
08:15:35,726 --> 08:15:37,777
Let's get a move on.

5191
08:15:41,198 --> 08:15:43,783
Eastbound on Avenida Atlantica.

5192
08:15:43,818 --> 08:15:45,284
Move, move, move, move.

5193
08:15:51,541 --> 08:15:53,209
It stopped about a block ahead.

5194
08:15:53,877 --> 08:15:55,294
Park it. We're going on foot.

5195
08:16:18,610 --> 08:16:19,735
Hey, Toretto.

5196
08:16:27,828 --> 08:16:29,453
You're under arrest.

5197
08:16:29,746 --> 08:16:30,913
Arrest?

5198
08:16:32,082 --> 08:16:34,000
I don't feel like I am under arrest.

5199
08:16:34,751 --> 08:16:36,002
How about you, Brian?

5200
08:16:36,037 --> 08:16:37,253
No, not a bit.

5201
08:16:39,214 --> 08:16:40,429
Not even a little bit.

5202
08:16:40,464 --> 08:16:42,800
Just give it a minute. It will sink in.

5203
08:16:46,221 --> 08:16:48,681
We didn't kill those feds. That was Reyes.

5204
08:16:48,716 --> 08:16:50,022
I don't give a shit.

5205
08:16:50,057 --> 08:16:52,935
I am just here to bring in two assholes
whose names hit my desk.

5206
08:16:53,228 --> 08:16:56,439
Yeah, that sounds like a real hero.

5207
08:16:59,484 --> 08:17:00,992
That's funny.

5208
08:17:01,027 --> 08:17:04,196
From a guy who took the oath of a cop,
then went against everything it stood for.

5209
08:17:04,231 --> 08:17:05,997
Or some wannabe tough guy prick

5210
08:17:06,032 --> 08:17:08,492
who beat a man half to death with
a socket wrench.

5211
08:17:09,244 --> 08:17:10,453
Yeah, real tough.

5212
08:17:11,455 --> 08:17:14,623
You turn around and put your
hands behind your back.

5213
08:17:15,792 --> 08:17:17,174
I don't think so.

5214
08:17:17,209 --> 08:17:19,920
Your mistake is thinking you
got a goddamn choice, boy.

5215
08:17:24,092 --> 08:17:25,676
And your mistake?

5216
08:17:26,303 --> 08:17:27,803
Thinking you're in America.

5217
08:17:30,974 --> 08:17:34,477
You're a long way from home.

5218
08:17:36,980 --> 08:17:39,482
This is Brazil.

5219
08:17:54,706 --> 08:17:56,957
Come on, boss. Another day.

5220
08:17:58,668 --> 08:18:01,128
Come on, H, it's a lot of heat.

5221
08:18:06,343 --> 08:18:08,677
I will see you soon, Toretto.

5222
08:18:10,013 --> 08:18:12,598
I look forward to it, cop.

5223
08:18:49,886 --> 08:18:50,851
Yep.

5224
08:18:50,886 --> 08:18:52,346
Tracker's on.

5225
08:18:53,723 --> 08:18:54,723
Got them.

5226
08:20:00,957 --> 08:20:03,334
I don't understand. Why come here?

5227
08:20:03,835 --> 08:20:06,670
Why risk it all for $20 worth of silver?

5228
08:20:10,258 --> 08:20:11,508
Because it's worth it.

5229
08:20:15,305 --> 08:20:16,847
You should run, you know.

5230
08:20:17,599 --> 08:20:19,016
Hobbs will find you.

5231
08:20:21,728 --> 08:20:24,647
You have every reason to leave.
Why stay?

5232
08:20:32,072 --> 08:20:34,156
Why do you?

5233
08:20:35,700 --> 08:20:37,701
My husband was a good police officer.

5234
08:20:38,536 --> 08:20:40,162
An honest man.

5235
08:20:41,581 --> 08:20:43,290
We both grew up here.

5236
08:20:44,334 --> 08:20:46,585
Two years ago he was murdered
in the street...

5237
08:20:46,620 --> 08:20:48,420
...right outside our door.

5238
08:20:50,924 --> 08:20:54,677
Reyes owns this favela now.
He gives things to people.

5239
08:20:57,013 --> 08:20:59,306
But everything has a price.

5240
08:21:02,018 --> 08:21:03,769
The people here need a new start.

5241
08:21:04,354 --> 08:21:05,854
They need to be free.

5242
08:21:15,740 --> 08:21:17,366
You didn't kill those men in the train,

5243
08:21:18,034 --> 08:21:19,326
did you?

5244
08:21:23,873 --> 08:21:26,667
Now, why would you believe anything
I would tell you?

5245
08:21:33,550 --> 08:21:34,842
Hey.

5246
08:21:38,221 --> 08:21:39,930
Was she so special to you?

5247
08:21:44,728 --> 08:21:47,062
I never thought
anyone could understand how much.

5248
08:21:50,525 --> 08:21:51,900
But you do.

5249
08:22:15,091 --> 08:22:16,091
Yeah.

5250
08:22:27,312 --> 08:22:28,604
Close, but not enough.

5251
08:22:29,147 --> 08:22:30,696
Dom, the window is too small, man.

5252
08:22:30,731 --> 08:22:34,568
Only way we're going to beat the
cameras is with invisible cars.

5253
08:22:37,280 --> 08:22:39,656
And I know just where to get them.

5254
08:22:42,786 --> 08:22:44,078
Let's take a ride, boys.

5255
08:22:51,961 --> 08:22:54,004
Don't hurt yourself.

5256
08:23:12,649 --> 08:23:15,025
It's been a while since I have been
behind the wheel of one of these.

5257
08:23:15,318 --> 08:23:17,236
First time I have ever been in the front seat.

5258
08:23:24,994 --> 08:23:26,537
Rome, what took you so long?

5259
08:23:26,913 --> 08:23:30,749
I thought for sure you'd be showing up with
some chrome spinners or something.

5260
08:23:31,835 --> 08:23:32,835
Real funny.

5261
08:23:34,337 --> 08:23:37,965
I got $100,000 that says I can take
you all in the next quarter-mile.

5262
08:23:38,000 --> 08:23:39,591
Yeah, your broke ass has got a hundred grand.

5263
08:23:39,626 --> 08:23:42,010
If we pull off this job, I will.

5264
08:23:42,387 --> 08:23:43,846
The next two lights.

5265
08:23:44,139 --> 08:23:45,305
Hundred thousand.

5266
08:23:46,266 --> 08:23:49,059
We don't pull this job off,
we're probably dead anyway.

5267
08:23:49,602 --> 08:23:51,645
Let's make it a million.

5268
08:23:52,522 --> 08:23:54,857
I like that. All right,
a million-dollar quarter-mile.

5269
08:23:56,109 --> 08:23:57,651
All right, then.

5270
08:23:57,944 --> 08:24:00,487
You only live once. Let's do it.

5271
08:24:00,989 --> 08:24:02,030
What do you say, Dom?

5272
08:24:02,699 --> 08:24:04,158
We talking or we racing?

5273
08:24:05,618 --> 08:24:06,702
Just don't cheat this time.

5274
08:24:07,328 --> 08:24:09,955
Got to let that go.

5275
08:24:28,558 --> 08:24:30,017
Yeah.

5276
08:24:33,104 --> 08:24:34,153
Typical, Roman.

5277
08:24:34,188 --> 08:24:36,732
I am going to get this money.
I am hungry.

5278
08:24:45,033 --> 08:24:46,700
Don't make it too easy for me, boys.

5279
08:24:49,537 --> 08:24:50,537
No.

5280
08:24:51,748 --> 08:24:53,499
Not this time, Dom.

5281
08:24:58,338 --> 08:25:00,088
You got to want it, Brian.

5282
08:25:28,284 --> 08:25:32,120
Yeah. Owned you. Owned you.

5283
08:25:46,886 --> 08:25:49,179
Good race, O'Conner. Thanks, Dom.

5284
08:25:51,140 --> 08:25:53,934
Do you know how long
I have been waiting for that shit?

5285
08:25:53,969 --> 08:25:55,978
I told you he didn't see it.

5286
08:25:56,187 --> 08:25:57,861
Your man right there?

5287
08:25:57,896 --> 08:26:00,544
He let off the throttle at the line.

5288
08:26:00,579 --> 08:26:03,193
You didn't do nothing. He let you win.

5289
08:26:04,153 --> 08:26:05,862
Bullshit.

5290
08:26:27,010 --> 08:26:29,803
Vince, what are you doing? Quiet.
They have been tracking you.

5291
08:26:38,438 --> 08:26:39,521
I know she's here.

5292
08:26:42,025 --> 08:26:43,463
Find her.

5293
08:26:43,498 --> 08:26:44,901
Go. Go. Go.

5294
08:26:59,292 --> 08:27:00,924
It's okay. Wait.

5295
08:27:00,959 --> 08:27:04,087
Reyes' guys were waiting for me at the market.

5296
08:27:05,048 --> 08:27:06,673
Vince saved my life.

5297
08:27:12,096 --> 08:27:13,555
You hungry?

5298
08:27:16,726 --> 08:27:19,144
Yeah, sure. Good.

5299
08:27:20,897 --> 08:27:22,105
Because you're saying grace.

5300
08:27:25,318 --> 08:27:26,735
Thanks, Vince.

5301
08:27:33,868 --> 08:27:34,916
Yo, you burned it.

5302
08:27:34,951 --> 08:27:37,961
Yo, this is how my momma does it.
Relax.

5303
08:27:37,996 --> 08:27:40,415
Yeah, but your mom is
the worst cook in the world.

5304
08:27:40,450 --> 08:27:43,377
Yo, don't you be talking about my momma.

5305
08:27:45,546 --> 08:27:47,902
Yeah, come on, baby. Who's good living?

5306
08:27:47,937 --> 08:27:50,265
To you, bro. Cheers, cheers, cheers.

5307
08:27:50,300 --> 08:27:52,594
So, we in Brazil. It's the good life.

5308
08:27:52,629 --> 08:27:53,644
Yeah.

5309
08:27:53,679 --> 08:27:57,557
So, you got a little more than
$10 or $11 million coming.

5310
08:27:57,592 --> 08:27:58,767
What you going to do with your money?

5311
08:27:58,802 --> 08:28:00,484
Me? Yeah.

5312
08:28:00,519 --> 08:28:03,355
Actually, man, I been thinking about
opening up a garage back home.

5313
08:28:04,315 --> 08:28:07,109
Place where people can bring their cars
and not get completely ripped off.

5314
08:28:07,144 --> 08:28:08,318
You know what I mean?

5315
08:28:08,353 --> 08:28:09,701
Really? Yeah.

5316
08:28:09,736 --> 08:28:12,343
So, your dream is to start a day job?

5317
08:28:12,378 --> 08:28:14,915
That's stupid. Like, why would...

5318
08:28:14,950 --> 08:28:17,619
No, it's not stupid at all.
I love what I do.

5319
08:28:17,654 --> 08:28:18,669
That don't make no sense to me.

5320
08:28:18,704 --> 08:28:21,623
I know what I am going to do with my money.

5321
08:28:23,626 --> 08:28:25,544
Buying some cooking lessons for my man.

5322
08:28:26,045 --> 08:28:27,469
See? See?

5323
08:28:27,504 --> 08:28:29,756
There you go with that negativity, man.

5324
08:28:29,791 --> 08:28:31,973
You know me. Money ain't a goddamn thing.

5325
08:28:32,008 --> 08:28:34,636
It's going to take a little more than
money to learn how to cook.

5326
08:28:34,671 --> 08:28:35,971
That's horrible.

5327
08:28:36,514 --> 08:28:40,183
But I heard they was looking for a
chef down at this animal shelter.

5328
08:28:40,218 --> 08:28:41,681
You might want to...

5329
08:28:41,716 --> 08:28:43,145
I know the manager.

5330
08:28:48,568 --> 08:28:50,235
Hey, Dom.

5331
08:28:52,947 --> 08:28:54,448
Listen.

5332
08:28:55,199 --> 08:28:58,910
I know that you're all
set for this job tomorrow,

5333
08:28:58,945 --> 08:29:00,746
but if you need an extra man, I could...

5334
08:29:00,781 --> 08:29:02,164
You're in.

5335
08:29:10,590 --> 08:29:12,132
There's always room for family.

5336
08:29:18,598 --> 08:29:19,639
Thank you.

5337
08:29:24,228 --> 08:29:25,353
Get something to eat.

5338
08:29:27,148 --> 08:29:28,774
Yeah.

5339
08:29:30,651 --> 08:29:32,360
Can you believe Mia calls this a curse?

5340
08:29:36,157 --> 08:29:38,325
She might be right.

5341
08:29:42,663 --> 08:29:45,123
You really like doing that stuff, huh?

5342
08:29:45,374 --> 08:29:49,628
When your life is on the line that's
when you learn about yourself.

5343
08:29:54,592 --> 08:29:56,343
That's a fair deal.

5344
08:29:59,639 --> 08:30:03,767
We're less than 24 hours from the
biggest celebration of our life.

5345
08:30:03,802 --> 08:30:06,144
You all need a refill.
This is serious stuff.

5346
08:30:06,179 --> 08:30:07,705
No, I am good. Cheers, baby.

5347
08:30:07,740 --> 08:30:09,231
I am good. No, thank you.

5348
08:30:09,266 --> 08:30:10,315
No, she can't.

5349
08:30:12,568 --> 08:30:14,569
What do you mean? She can't.

5350
08:30:14,904 --> 08:30:17,572
What do you mean she can't?
What is...

5351
08:30:21,744 --> 08:30:23,960
Are you serious right now?

5352
08:30:23,995 --> 08:30:27,791
Is that the reason you let him
beat you in the quarter-mile?

5353
08:30:29,126 --> 08:30:32,379
That was a baby gift.
No, that's messed up.

5354
08:30:32,414 --> 08:30:34,047
No, you're not taking that from me.

5355
08:30:34,082 --> 08:30:35,722
Wait, wait, hold on a second.

5356
08:30:35,757 --> 08:30:40,136
So, did he just smack the ass or
did he grab and hold on to it?

5357
08:30:40,513 --> 08:30:41,478
Which one was it?

5358
08:30:41,513 --> 08:30:43,765
Congratulations. Thank you.

5359
08:30:43,800 --> 08:30:45,951
How can you keep this a secret?

5360
08:30:45,986 --> 08:30:48,068
Crazy, huh?
It's your boy.

5361
08:30:48,103 --> 08:30:51,773
Why would you keep something
like that away from me?

5362
08:30:52,108 --> 08:30:53,900
Baby gift, huh?

5363
08:30:54,151 --> 08:30:56,987
I have no idea what they're talking about.
Oh?

5364
08:30:57,022 --> 08:31:00,073
What happened to the pull-out method, man?

5365
08:31:01,158 --> 08:31:03,201
Toast. Toast.

5366
08:31:11,544 --> 08:31:14,796
Money will come and go. We know that.

5367
08:31:15,923 --> 08:31:19,301
But the most important thing in life will
always be the people in this room.

5368
08:31:20,720 --> 08:31:21,970
Right here.

5369
08:31:24,599 --> 08:31:25,640
Right now.

5370
08:31:40,239 --> 08:31:41,823
I am all set.

5371
08:31:42,825 --> 08:31:45,827
Yo, Santos. Van good?

5372
08:31:46,913 --> 08:31:49,122
You know we're always good, bro.

5373
08:31:53,002 --> 08:31:55,712
Hobbs is on the other side of the city.

5374
08:31:55,747 --> 08:31:58,423
We're not going to get a better window.

5375
08:31:58,458 --> 08:32:00,724
Okay, guys, it's show time.

5376
08:32:00,759 --> 08:32:02,427
First team in position, let's go.

5377
08:32:02,462 --> 08:32:03,762
Come on, let's do this.

5378
08:32:16,067 --> 08:32:17,067
Hey, Dom.

5379
08:32:18,903 --> 08:32:20,028
I got eyes on Mia.

5380
08:32:25,034 --> 08:32:28,119
Moscow, Bali, Goa, Hong Kong.

5381
08:32:28,746 --> 08:32:30,622
And what do they all have in common?

5382
08:32:30,657 --> 08:32:31,790
No extradition.

5383
08:32:33,876 --> 08:32:36,628
We're one hour away from the rest of our lives.

5384
08:32:36,663 --> 08:32:38,004
Yeah.

5385
08:32:39,715 --> 08:32:40,715
Cops.

5386
08:32:43,302 --> 08:32:44,678
Come on. Go.

5387
08:32:56,273 --> 08:32:57,899
You just made a big mistake.

5388
08:32:59,402 --> 08:33:01,319
Took me a while to find that tracking chip.

5389
08:33:01,821 --> 08:33:03,196
But not as long to flip the receiver.

5390
08:33:03,231 --> 08:33:04,781
You're going down, Toretto.

5391
08:33:05,116 --> 08:33:06,908
I am right here.

5392
08:34:35,039 --> 08:34:37,040
Dom. Stand back. I got this.

5393
08:34:42,963 --> 08:34:46,883
Pull off. Dom. Please, stop.

5394
08:34:52,515 --> 08:34:53,515
Dom.

5395
08:35:02,691 --> 08:35:04,025
Dom.

5396
08:36:06,547 --> 08:36:07,589
Yeah.

5397
08:36:08,966 --> 08:36:10,925
We're coming in now.

5398
08:36:12,511 --> 08:36:15,180
Have the marshals meet us at
the airport when we land.

5399
08:36:23,063 --> 08:36:24,439
Ambush.

5400
08:36:42,082 --> 08:36:45,293
Wilkes, suppression fire. Shut them down.

5401
08:36:49,506 --> 08:36:51,174
Stagger-step. Cover me.

5402
08:36:56,180 --> 08:36:57,222
Watch them.

5403
08:37:08,817 --> 08:37:09,866
Cut us loose.

5404
08:37:09,901 --> 08:37:11,986
Come on. Cut us loose.

5405
08:39:10,439 --> 08:39:11,814
We're good? Yeah, let's go, let's go.

5406
08:39:45,099 --> 08:39:46,724
Hey, Dom.

5407
08:39:52,981 --> 08:39:55,149
You have got to meet my son.

5408
08:39:55,442 --> 08:39:57,193
Nico.

5409
08:40:01,949 --> 08:40:03,408
I will.

5410
08:40:06,328 --> 08:40:07,578
He's a good kid.

5411
08:40:11,417 --> 08:40:14,043
You know, we named him after you.

5412
08:40:15,838 --> 08:40:17,171
"Dominic. "

5413
08:40:24,430 --> 08:40:26,431
You have got my word, Vince.

5414
08:40:32,980 --> 08:40:35,064
You were always my brother.

5415
08:40:44,700 --> 08:40:47,201
I got eyes on Nico now.

5416
08:40:57,880 --> 08:41:00,298
We need to move.
We don't have that much time.

5417
08:41:00,333 --> 08:41:01,472
I got us a flight out.

5418
08:41:01,507 --> 08:41:04,177
We can leave Rio in the
rearview in the next five hours.

5419
08:41:04,212 --> 08:41:06,053
Not to run away.

5420
08:41:07,473 --> 08:41:09,056
To finish the job.

5421
08:41:09,892 --> 08:41:12,310
Are you crazy, Dom? We can't.

5422
08:41:12,895 --> 08:41:14,479
It's a suicide mission.

5423
08:41:15,564 --> 08:41:17,231
That's your man over there on the table.

5424
08:41:18,609 --> 08:41:20,651
The plan is busted.

5425
08:41:20,944 --> 08:41:23,446
This is bullshit, man.
Reyes knows we're coming.

5426
08:41:23,481 --> 08:41:24,906
He's right.

5427
08:41:25,199 --> 08:41:27,992
They tripled the detail at the police station.

5428
08:41:28,410 --> 08:41:30,661
It's going to be a wall of gunfire.

5429
08:41:32,873 --> 08:41:34,957
Reyes doesn't get away with this.

5430
08:41:35,250 --> 08:41:36,501
It's a trap, man.

5431
08:41:36,536 --> 08:41:37,752
You know that.

5432
08:41:38,420 --> 08:41:40,755
Dom, listen to them.

5433
08:41:41,423 --> 08:41:44,008
Run, before it's too late. Leave Rio.

5434
08:41:45,385 --> 08:41:46,719
You can be free.

5435
08:41:48,889 --> 08:41:50,890
Running ain't freedom.

5436
08:41:52,351 --> 08:41:53,768
You should know that.

5437
08:41:58,857 --> 08:42:01,275
You know you're all free to
make your own choices.

5438
08:42:05,489 --> 08:42:06,614
I am in.

5439
08:42:15,999 --> 08:42:17,625
I will ride with you, Toretto.

5440
08:42:20,921 --> 08:42:23,464
At least until we kill that son of a bitch.

5441
08:42:31,890 --> 08:42:33,474
So what's the plan, Dom?

5442
08:42:34,309 --> 08:42:36,352
We can't just go sneaking around anymore.

5443
08:42:37,854 --> 08:42:39,814
We don't sneak.

5444
08:42:40,607 --> 08:42:43,734
The only thing he cares about is his money.

5445
08:42:43,986 --> 08:42:45,319
We pull that,

5446
08:42:46,321 --> 08:42:47,738
we pull him.

5447
08:43:05,132 --> 08:43:06,173
See?

5448
08:43:07,342 --> 08:43:10,011
I called in every cop on our payroll.

5449
08:43:11,513 --> 08:43:13,306
We're covered.

5450
08:43:15,017 --> 08:43:17,143
We have got every entrance covered
with weapons teams.

5451
08:43:17,178 --> 08:43:19,270
God Himself couldn't get at your
money if He wanted to.

5452
08:43:19,771 --> 08:43:24,108
God isn't my worry.

5453
08:43:33,869 --> 08:43:34,869
You ready?

5454
08:43:37,164 --> 08:43:38,164
I am ready.

5455
08:44:36,515 --> 08:44:37,605
What's happening?

5456
08:44:37,640 --> 08:44:39,183
They're taking the vault.

5457
08:44:39,218 --> 08:44:40,935
What? The vault.

5458
08:44:50,487 --> 08:44:53,739
Follow me. Quickly.

5459
08:44:58,078 --> 08:44:59,578
Let me through.

5460
08:45:09,631 --> 08:45:10,631
Don't move.

5461
08:45:11,842 --> 08:45:13,217
Stay down.

5462
08:45:43,206 --> 08:45:44,547
Call it out, Mia.

5463
08:45:44,582 --> 08:45:46,167
You have got a straight shot for two blocks.

5464
08:45:47,669 --> 08:45:49,170
Go right. Got it.

5465
08:46:11,568 --> 08:46:13,117
Well, the plan is working.

5466
08:46:13,152 --> 08:46:18,115
You guys have every corrupt cop in Rio
on your tail. You have to move fast.

5467
08:46:18,150 --> 08:46:19,248
What's the best route?

5468
08:46:19,283 --> 08:46:22,620
Okay, keep going straight another
half-mile onto Rua Fonseca,

5469
08:46:22,655 --> 08:46:24,622
and then go left.

5470
08:46:28,376 --> 08:46:29,418
That ain't going to work.

5471
08:46:31,505 --> 08:46:33,088
Spikes ahead, Dom. We got spikes.

5472
08:46:33,507 --> 08:46:35,090
We're going right.

5473
08:46:36,468 --> 08:46:37,760
No, it's too tight, we're not going to fit.

5474
08:46:37,795 --> 08:46:39,303
We have got no choice. Now.

5475
08:46:58,990 --> 08:47:00,157
Shit.

5476
08:47:06,790 --> 08:47:08,047
Holy shit.

5477
08:47:08,082 --> 08:47:11,043
Guys, I am hearing all this chatter.
Did you just take out a bank?

5478
08:47:20,095 --> 08:47:21,095
Two inbound.

5479
08:47:23,515 --> 08:47:24,974
All right, there's an alley
coming up on your left.

5480
08:47:25,009 --> 08:47:26,725
Yeah, I got it.

5481
08:48:20,113 --> 08:48:21,739
You little bastard.

5482
08:48:44,888 --> 08:48:47,598
All right, good job, Dom. Right-hander,
right here, right-hander.

5483
08:48:53,980 --> 08:48:56,023
Guys, there's a big group coming
at you from the south.

5484
08:48:56,058 --> 08:48:57,900
You have to do something now.

5485
08:49:00,779 --> 08:49:01,820
Hey, go wide.

5486
08:49:34,604 --> 08:49:35,604
Yeah.

5487
08:50:49,471 --> 08:50:50,763
You're all clear on the left.

5488
08:50:50,798 --> 08:50:52,681
Good afternoon, officer.

5489
08:50:54,684 --> 08:50:57,102
License and registration, please.

5490
08:51:03,318 --> 08:51:05,507
Yes. This is big-boy stuff.

5491
08:51:05,542 --> 08:51:07,696
We're clear on the right.

5492
08:51:07,947 --> 08:51:09,031
Oh, man.

5493
08:51:15,830 --> 08:51:16,872
Thanks, guys.

5494
08:51:17,248 --> 08:51:18,373
Any time.

5495
08:51:18,666 --> 08:51:20,215
I will see you on the other side.

5496
08:51:20,250 --> 08:51:22,628
You guys just carved out a 10-second window.

5497
08:51:22,663 --> 08:51:24,171
Make it count.

5498
08:51:40,900 --> 08:51:42,066
Zizi, stay on them.

5499
08:52:09,000 --> 08:52:10,918
They can't outrun us on the bridge.

5500
08:52:12,879 --> 08:52:13,879
Shit.

5501
08:52:20,970 --> 08:52:22,179
They have no way out.

5502
08:52:24,182 --> 08:52:25,182
No.

5503
08:52:26,017 --> 08:52:27,065
There's too many of them.

5504
08:52:27,100 --> 08:52:29,144
Hey, there's too many of them.
We're not going to make it.

5505
08:52:32,857 --> 08:52:33,857
You're right, we aren't.

5506
08:52:35,151 --> 08:52:36,074
You are.

5507
08:52:36,109 --> 08:52:37,486
What are you talking about?

5508
08:52:37,695 --> 08:52:40,113
Just let the vault go.
Get out of there.

5509
08:52:40,148 --> 08:52:41,872
You're a father now, Brian.

5510
08:52:41,907 --> 08:52:44,159
No, I am not leaving you.
Now you stick with the plan.

5511
08:52:44,869 --> 08:52:46,244
It was always the plan.

5512
08:52:46,996 --> 08:52:48,253
Take care of Mia.

5513
08:52:48,288 --> 08:52:50,791
Dom, you listen to me now. Okay?

5514
08:52:50,826 --> 08:52:52,709
You cut loose right now.

5515
08:53:10,061 --> 08:53:11,103
Hey, what is he doing?

5516
08:53:15,066 --> 08:53:16,191
We have got him.

5517
08:53:33,042 --> 08:53:34,292
Close down the bridge.

5518
08:54:08,536 --> 08:54:09,911
Do something, asshole.

5519
08:54:22,008 --> 08:54:23,133
Kill him, damn it.

5520
08:54:34,520 --> 08:54:35,979
Kill him now.

5521
08:55:47,677 --> 08:55:50,387
I thought I told you to go on.

5522
08:55:52,348 --> 08:55:54,558
Yeah, I had to make a call.

5523
08:56:12,160 --> 08:56:13,577
Help me.

5524
08:56:15,955 --> 08:56:17,956
That's for my team, you son of a bitch.

5525
08:56:22,128 --> 08:56:23,837
It's a hell of a mess.

5526
08:56:24,547 --> 08:56:26,173
Yeah, it is.

5527
08:56:27,675 --> 08:56:29,426
You know I can't let you two go.

5528
08:56:29,927 --> 08:56:31,511
I ain't made that way.

5529
08:56:34,265 --> 08:56:36,933
The way I see it,
you have earned yourselves 24 hours.

5530
08:56:38,102 --> 08:56:39,102
The money stays, though.

5531
08:56:40,438 --> 08:56:42,606
If I were you, I'd use the time.

5532
08:56:42,940 --> 08:56:45,942
Make peace with whatever demons you got left.

5533
08:56:50,406 --> 08:56:52,282
Because come tomorrow,

5534
08:56:53,659 --> 08:56:54,784
I will find you.

5535
08:57:06,631 --> 08:57:07,923
Toretto.

5536
08:57:08,841 --> 08:57:10,133
I will see you soon.

5537
08:57:12,970 --> 08:57:14,846
No, you won't.

5538
08:58:26,400 --> 08:58:28,234
Come on, baby.

5539
08:58:28,269 --> 08:58:30,069
Don't be mean.

5540
08:58:32,323 --> 08:58:33,323
Come on.

5541
08:59:44,937 --> 08:59:48,398
"For Rosa and Nico. See you soon, Uncle Dom"

5542
09:00:01,453 --> 09:00:02,537
You sure about this?

5543
09:00:04,331 --> 09:00:05,790
You know I am.

5544
09:00:07,751 --> 09:00:09,210
You don't need to do this.

5545
09:00:10,212 --> 09:00:12,512
Just leave me alone.

5546
09:00:12,547 --> 09:00:14,674
Bro, I am not trying to be negative,
but casinos...

5547
09:00:14,883 --> 09:00:17,593
...are the kinds of places designed to
take money from guys like you and me.

5548
09:00:17,628 --> 09:00:21,431
When I win here I am buying you a lifetime
supply of antidepressants.

5549
09:00:21,724 --> 09:00:24,726
You don't put ten million on red.

5550
09:00:24,761 --> 09:00:25,733
Enough already.

5551
09:00:25,768 --> 09:00:27,228
You put it on black.

5552
09:00:29,815 --> 09:00:30,940
No more bets.

5553
09:00:56,967 --> 09:00:59,177
Right this way, my dear.

5554
09:01:01,221 --> 09:01:03,055
You stay right here,
I will be right back.

5555
09:01:04,892 --> 09:01:06,664
So, this is your dream, huh?

5556
09:01:06,699 --> 09:01:08,318
It's enough for me, man.

5557
09:01:08,353 --> 09:01:09,902
I take it that's your dream.

5558
09:01:09,937 --> 09:01:12,607
Absolutely. What up, boy?
What's going on?

5559
09:01:12,642 --> 09:01:14,209
You good? Yes, yes.

5560
09:01:14,244 --> 09:01:15,742
You know what's crazy?

5561
09:01:15,777 --> 09:01:18,446
There's only four of those cars
in the whole world.

5562
09:01:18,989 --> 09:01:21,407
Yeah, I got the only one in the
Western Hemisphere.

5563
09:01:21,909 --> 09:01:26,204
I made a sheikh in Abu Dhabi
an offer he could not refuse.

5564
09:01:26,538 --> 09:01:28,790
Huh.
That's a nice lady you got there, too.

5565
09:01:28,825 --> 09:01:32,293
Absolutely. What's happening?

5566
09:01:33,086 --> 09:01:35,296
We got to go, man. Let's do this.

5567
09:01:35,331 --> 09:01:37,013
Okay, I will drive.

5568
09:01:37,048 --> 09:01:39,675
In that? Come on, man, no way.

5569
09:01:39,710 --> 09:01:42,053
No, no. Not in this.

5570
09:01:42,088 --> 09:01:43,304
In that.

5571
09:01:49,645 --> 09:01:51,187
Are you serious right now?

5572
09:01:51,980 --> 09:01:53,279
Man, this is crazy.

5573
09:01:53,314 --> 09:01:57,985
Yes, I guess that means there are two
in the Western Hemisphere, huh?

5574
09:01:58,862 --> 09:02:01,197
What's your smart ass got to say now?

5575
09:02:01,740 --> 09:02:05,159
You know what?
We can always shine together, baby.

5576
09:02:05,194 --> 09:02:07,620
Get dressed, man, we got things to do.

5577
09:02:20,050 --> 09:02:21,592
So, where to now?

5578
09:02:21,627 --> 09:02:23,100
I don't know.

5579
09:02:23,135 --> 09:02:25,561
Never been to Madrid.

5580
09:02:25,596 --> 09:02:28,432
I thought you wanted to go to Tokyo.

5581
09:02:28,467 --> 09:02:30,685
We will get there.

5582
09:02:30,720 --> 09:02:32,395
Eventually.

5583
09:03:31,747 --> 09:03:33,581
Nice surprise.

5584
09:03:37,169 --> 09:03:38,836
Crazy, right?

5585
09:03:47,054 --> 09:03:50,097
This is the happiest
I have ever seen my sister.

5586
09:03:51,141 --> 09:03:53,142
It's because we're free.

5587
09:04:06,490 --> 09:04:08,741
You know, I want another shot.

5588
09:04:12,287 --> 09:04:13,287
Yeah?

5589
09:04:15,374 --> 09:04:17,006
Yeah.

5590
09:04:17,041 --> 09:04:18,925
No wagers, nobody else.

5591
09:04:18,960 --> 09:04:21,212
Just you and me, once and for all.

5592
09:04:28,303 --> 09:04:30,262
You sure you can handle the disappointment?

5593
09:04:31,139 --> 09:04:32,556
Are you?

5594
09:04:34,851 --> 09:04:36,852
All right, O'Conner.

5595
09:04:36,887 --> 09:04:38,854
Let's see what you got.

5596
09:05:32,100 --> 09:05:34,194
<i>Señor</i> O'Conner, <i>señor</i> O'Conner!

5597
09:05:39,649 --> 09:05:41,651
It's okay, you're just in time.

5598
09:05:41,734 --> 09:05:43,486
You're going to be a great father, Brian.

5599
09:05:44,821 --> 09:05:46,073
What makes you so sure?

5600
09:05:46,197 --> 09:05:48,245
Because I'll be there to kick your ass if you ain't.

5601
09:05:49,409 --> 09:05:50,581
Get in there.
Go.

5602
09:05:52,745 --> 09:05:53,871
Brian.

5603
09:05:54,831 --> 09:05:57,630
Remember, the second you go through those doors,

5604
09:05:58,835 --> 09:06:00,178
<i>everything changes.</i>

5605
09:06:01,337 --> 09:06:03,135
Our old life is done.

5606
09:06:30,300 --> 09:06:32,135
You need to look at that.

5607
09:06:36,056 --> 09:06:38,015
Berlin, 3:00 a. m. this morning.

5608
09:06:38,267 --> 09:06:41,060
A team of drivers hijacked a military convoy.

5609
09:06:41,095 --> 09:06:42,979
Toretto? Nope.

5610
09:06:43,981 --> 09:06:44,904
I ain't interested.

5611
09:06:44,939 --> 09:06:47,859
Yes, you are. Keep looking.

5612
09:06:59,371 --> 09:07:01,205
Do you believe in ghosts?

5613
09:07:26,200 --> 09:07:28,077
Special Agent Hobbs?
Riley Hicks.

5614
09:07:28,244 --> 09:07:30,997
I read your file. Top
of your class at FLETC.

5615
09:07:31,164 --> 09:07:32,507
Cairo, Tunis.

5616
09:07:32,665 --> 09:07:34,793
Youngest RSO ever in Afghanistan.

5617
09:07:34,959 --> 09:07:38,213
Hell, if you're half as good as you are on paper,

5618
09:07:38,379 --> 09:07:40,097
we're going to get along just fine.

5619
09:07:40,214 --> 09:07:42,182
A Russian military caravan attacked,

5620
09:07:42,341 --> 09:07:44,469
satellite component stolen.

5621
09:07:44,635 --> 09:07:46,262
Cars just came out of nowhere.

5622
09:07:46,429 --> 09:07:48,431
Six hospitalized, a dozen vehicles destroyed.

5623
09:07:48,598 --> 09:07:51,147
All that in under 90 seconds, in and out.

5624
09:07:51,225 --> 09:07:52,272
This is world-class.

5625
09:07:52,351 --> 09:07:53,985
Job this good, there's only one crew in the world

5626
09:07:54,020 --> 09:07:55,112
who could get this done.

5627
09:07:56,814 --> 09:07:58,175
How the hell did that get up there?

5628
09:08:02,278 --> 09:08:03,495
They caught one.

5629
09:08:03,654 --> 09:08:04,746
Where?

5630
09:08:08,076 --> 09:08:10,044
I got you five minutes with this guy.

5631
09:08:10,203 --> 09:08:12,672
I only need two.

5632
09:08:22,924 --> 09:08:25,097
I want your boss.
Where's Shaw?

5633
09:08:30,640 --> 09:08:32,142
I ain't telling you shit.

5634
09:08:32,308 --> 09:08:34,606
I was hoping you'd say that.

5635
09:08:41,067 --> 09:08:42,193
Is that legal?

5636
09:08:42,276 --> 09:08:43,323
No.

5637
09:08:45,029 --> 09:08:46,997
But are you going to go in there and tell him?

5638
09:08:52,703 --> 09:08:55,001
I've got rights, you asshole!

5639
09:08:55,164 --> 09:08:56,962
Not today.

5640
09:09:03,798 --> 09:09:04,890
No, no!

5641
09:09:14,308 --> 09:09:15,605
Well, is he talking?
Not anymore.

5642
09:09:15,726 --> 09:09:16,807
That room is bugged, Hobbs.

5643
09:09:16,894 --> 09:09:19,192
So, any information you just beat
out of him, Interpol has now.

5644
09:09:19,355 --> 09:09:22,154
Great. Now they can take the morning off.
Shaw's in London.

5645
09:09:22,316 --> 09:09:23,408
Let's go pick him up.

5646
09:09:23,568 --> 09:09:26,117
Woman, you just don't pick up
Owen Shaw like he's groceries.

5647
09:09:26,279 --> 09:09:28,657
If you want to catch wolves, you need wolves.

5648
09:09:28,823 --> 09:09:30,450
Let's go hunting.

5649
09:10:25,755 --> 09:10:27,974
This is what 100 million buys?

5650
09:10:29,383 --> 09:10:31,886
It wasn't that hard to find you, Toretto.

5651
09:10:34,055 --> 09:10:35,523
I wasn't hiding.

5652
09:10:39,602 --> 09:10:42,196
How's the life of the retired international criminal?

5653
09:10:42,563 --> 09:10:45,737
I like it here.
It's quiet.

5654
09:10:46,234 --> 09:10:47,486
Nice weather,

5655
09:10:48,819 --> 09:10:49,945
and no extradition.

5656
09:10:51,322 --> 09:10:53,620
So what are you doing here, cop?

5657
09:10:53,783 --> 09:10:56,161
Last Tuesday, a team of highly coordinated drivers

5658
09:10:56,327 --> 09:10:58,796
took down an entire military convoy in Russia.

5659
09:10:58,955 --> 09:11:00,377
I don't do cold weather.

5660
09:11:00,498 --> 09:11:01,545
I know it wasn't you.

5661
09:11:02,500 --> 09:11:04,661
But you're going to help me catch the team responsible.

5662
09:11:05,544 --> 09:11:07,296
And you ain't gonna need that.

5663
09:11:09,423 --> 09:11:11,175
You can't touch him, Hobbs.
You've got no powers...

5664
09:11:11,342 --> 09:11:13,515
I'm not here to extradite anyone.

5665
09:11:13,678 --> 09:11:15,351
See, he's going to come voluntarily.

5666
09:11:15,513 --> 09:11:17,106
As a matter of fact,

5667
09:11:18,599 --> 09:11:19,851
he's going to beg me.

5668
09:11:21,852 --> 09:11:23,820
This was taken a week ago.

5669
09:11:26,357 --> 09:11:28,030
I'll see you out front.

5670
09:11:48,671 --> 09:11:50,298
It's Letty, isn't it?

5671
09:11:51,299 --> 09:11:53,176
It's impossible.

5672
09:11:57,221 --> 09:12:01,977
If that was my husband, if there
was a chance, no matter how small,

5673
09:12:04,353 --> 09:12:05,730
I would go.

5674
09:12:23,331 --> 09:12:26,756
I'm going to need everything, all the info you got.

5675
09:12:26,917 --> 09:12:28,544
You'll get it when the team gets it.

5676
09:12:28,711 --> 09:12:30,054
No team.

5677
09:12:31,088 --> 09:12:33,011
This is going to have to be me alone.

5678
09:12:33,174 --> 09:12:34,892
It's not that simple.

5679
09:12:35,051 --> 09:12:37,850
The crew we're after, they hit like
thunder and disappear like smoke.

5680
09:12:38,012 --> 09:12:40,561
You go in alone, you won't ever touch them.

5681
09:12:40,723 --> 09:12:43,397
I've been chasing this guy across
four continents and 12 countries,

5682
09:12:43,559 --> 09:12:45,840
and believe me, the last damn place I want to be right now

5683
09:12:45,936 --> 09:12:49,065
is on your front doorstep, selling Girl Scout cookies.

5684
09:12:50,274 --> 09:12:52,197
I need your help, Dom.

5685
09:12:54,236 --> 09:12:56,364
I need your team.

5686
09:13:00,368 --> 09:13:01,620
Okay, ladies, bring it in.

5687
09:13:01,786 --> 09:13:03,629
Listen, I want to make a toast.

5688
09:13:03,788 --> 09:13:04,960
Come on.

5689
09:13:06,248 --> 09:13:09,422
Listen, I know a few of y'all have already been to Macau,

5690
09:13:09,585 --> 09:13:11,212
but you have never seen the town

5691
09:13:11,295 --> 09:13:12,495
till you've seen it through my eyes.

5692
09:13:12,671 --> 09:13:14,389
We got a penthouse suite

5693
09:13:14,465 --> 09:13:16,199
with an ocean view that's going to change your life.

5694
09:13:16,300 --> 09:13:19,019
150-foot yacht with
a helicopter pad...

5695
09:13:19,178 --> 09:13:22,682
Mmm-hmm. Safe to say, you're about
to have the time of your lives.

5696
09:13:22,890 --> 09:13:24,813
No, you are.

5697
09:13:24,975 --> 09:13:26,602
Cheers.

5698
09:14:14,400 --> 09:14:15,617
Nice!

5699
09:14:17,528 --> 09:14:19,451
I'm a citizen of the world.

5700
09:14:22,032 --> 09:14:24,660
Ever thought about settling down?

5701
09:14:24,827 --> 09:14:26,500
Starting a life together?

5702
09:14:26,954 --> 09:14:28,581
Aren't we doing that?

5703
09:14:30,332 --> 09:14:32,130
Are we?

5704
09:14:57,109 --> 09:14:58,361
Hello?

5705
09:14:59,487 --> 09:15:00,659
Dom?

5706
09:15:02,323 --> 09:15:03,825
I'll be there.

5707
09:15:04,366 --> 09:15:07,290
Hey, my man, I need you to turn this plane around.

5708
09:15:07,828 --> 09:15:10,206
All right, listen, ladies. There's
been a little change of plans.

5709
09:15:10,372 --> 09:15:11,498
Something came up.

5710
09:15:11,665 --> 09:15:13,838
You know that casino I was telling you all about?

5711
09:15:14,001 --> 09:15:15,753
I got some vouchers

5712
09:15:15,920 --> 09:15:17,263
to the buffet.

5713
09:15:28,724 --> 09:15:30,476
What do you think of this?

5714
09:15:31,727 --> 09:15:34,105
He likes it.
All right.

5715
09:15:34,605 --> 09:15:35,652
Yes.

5716
09:15:35,731 --> 09:15:36,857
Or this?

5717
09:15:37,650 --> 09:15:38,993
Yes.

5718
09:15:40,861 --> 09:15:43,102
That's my boy. All right, let's
see how this thing flies.

5719
09:15:43,656 --> 09:15:44,999
Are you watching?

5720
09:15:51,914 --> 09:15:53,916
It's Uncle Dom.
What do you know?

5721
09:15:54,500 --> 09:15:56,252
Are you waving?
What up?

5722
09:15:56,418 --> 09:15:58,011
Hey, Jack.

5723
09:15:58,170 --> 09:16:00,514
What's up, Uncle Dom?
What's up, Uncle Dom?

5724
09:16:00,673 --> 09:16:02,391
You excited to see him?

5725
09:16:02,550 --> 09:16:04,268
Are you already pushing imports on him?

5726
09:16:04,426 --> 09:16:06,394
You say, "Dad's not
pushing anything."

5727
09:16:06,554 --> 09:16:07,851
He chose that car.

5728
09:16:08,013 --> 09:16:09,560
We know he's an O'Conner, but,

5729
09:16:10,266 --> 09:16:11,859
I brought you something, Jack.

5730
09:16:12,726 --> 09:16:15,104
Yeah! He's also a Toretto.
I don't know.

5731
09:16:15,271 --> 09:16:17,899
Luckily, he has a couple more years to decide, right?

5732
09:16:18,065 --> 09:16:19,863
I think he decided, Mia.

5733
09:16:21,402 --> 09:16:23,075
I think it's time for his nap.

5734
09:16:23,237 --> 09:16:25,114
Come on, baby. Okay.

5735
09:16:27,241 --> 09:16:28,413
Say bye.

5736
09:16:28,742 --> 09:16:30,039
<i>It's weird, huh?</i>

5737
09:16:31,370 --> 09:16:33,213
What's weird?

5738
09:16:35,040 --> 09:16:36,542
We got everything.

5739
09:16:36,917 --> 09:16:39,716
You know, down to the beer and the barbeque.

5740
09:16:39,878 --> 09:16:42,131
But it just...

5741
09:16:42,214 --> 09:16:44,888
I don't know, it just doesn't feel like home.

5742
09:16:45,759 --> 09:16:47,887
Maybe it's because, uh,

5743
09:16:48,679 --> 09:16:50,522
you don't realize how much you appreciate something

5744
09:16:50,598 --> 09:16:52,566
until somebody takes it away.

5745
09:16:53,267 --> 09:16:54,519
I don't know.

5746
09:16:55,394 --> 09:16:56,941
The place has probably changed so much,

5747
09:16:57,021 --> 09:16:58,981
you wouldn't even recognize it anymore.

5748
09:16:59,064 --> 09:17:00,281
Yeah.

5749
09:17:02,610 --> 09:17:04,612
Everything's changed.

5750
09:17:05,571 --> 09:17:08,074
So what's up with you?
What's going on?

5751
09:17:15,247 --> 09:17:17,420
Taken a week ago.

5752
09:17:17,583 --> 09:17:20,086
Diplomatic Security Service.

5753
09:17:20,753 --> 09:17:21,925
Hobbs.

5754
09:17:27,593 --> 09:17:30,767
You know, I used to do this shit all the time as a cop.

5755
09:17:31,263 --> 09:17:34,642
This is exactly what cops do.
He's messing with your head.

5756
09:17:44,568 --> 09:17:46,491
Letty's dead, Dom.

5757
09:17:46,654 --> 09:17:48,748
I need to know for sure.

5758
09:17:50,783 --> 09:17:52,126
Then I'm going with you.

5759
09:17:52,284 --> 09:17:53,627
You said you were going to leave this life behind.

5760
09:17:53,786 --> 09:17:55,788
We both said that we were leaving the life behind.

5761
09:17:56,413 --> 09:17:57,790
He's right.

5762
09:17:58,290 --> 09:17:59,587
We're family.

5763
09:18:00,084 --> 09:18:02,758
If we got a problem, we deal with it together.

5764
09:18:03,295 --> 09:18:05,548
And I'll feel safer knowing you're both out there,

5765
09:18:05,631 --> 09:18:07,804
watching each other's backs.

5766
09:18:08,133 --> 09:18:11,979
You're stronger together.
You always were.

5767
09:18:13,889 --> 09:18:15,482
Now go get Letty.

5768
09:18:17,935 --> 09:18:18,982
<i>Bring her home.</i>

5769
09:18:37,621 --> 09:18:39,123
Thank God!

5770
09:18:39,289 --> 09:18:41,166
Finally, some equipment I can work with.

5771
09:18:41,333 --> 09:18:42,380
What up, boy?

5772
09:18:42,459 --> 09:18:44,300
This is way better than that trash in Rio.

5773
09:18:45,838 --> 09:18:47,511
Way better.

5774
09:18:51,802 --> 09:18:52,974
You sure about these guys?

5775
09:18:53,303 --> 09:18:54,680
Nope.

5776
09:18:56,306 --> 09:18:58,274
Has anybody heard from Leo or Santos?

5777
09:18:58,434 --> 09:19:02,109
Last time anyone saw them, they were
hitting up the casinos in Monte Carlo.

5778
09:19:02,271 --> 09:19:04,273
I thought that was our last job, Brian.

5779
09:19:04,440 --> 09:19:06,989
And who's paying for all this equipment?
The taxpayers?

5780
09:19:07,192 --> 09:19:09,866
So now we work for The Hulk?
That's what we're doing?

5781
09:19:11,739 --> 09:19:13,082
Why do I smell baby oil?

5782
09:19:13,240 --> 09:19:14,366
If you keep running your piehole,

5783
09:19:14,450 --> 09:19:15,890
you're going to
smell an ass-kicking.

5784
09:19:15,951 --> 09:19:16,998
All right, Hobbs,

5785
09:19:17,494 --> 09:19:18,837
you got the best crew in the world

5786
09:19:18,912 --> 09:19:20,255
standing right in front of you.

5787
09:19:21,540 --> 09:19:23,338
Give them a reason to stay.

5788
09:19:25,169 --> 09:19:27,263
Our target is Owen Shaw.

5789
09:19:27,629 --> 09:19:30,599
Former major in the S.A.S.,
Spec-ops soldier.

5790
09:19:30,758 --> 09:19:33,432
He ran the UK's Mobility Division in Kabul and Basra.

5791
09:19:33,594 --> 09:19:36,268
Ah, damn. That Mobility
unit's the truth.

5792
09:19:36,805 --> 09:19:40,560
We're talking vehicular warfare.
Best in the world.

5793
09:19:40,893 --> 09:19:43,013
- You got some chips?
- Those guys don't mess around.

5794
09:19:44,271 --> 09:19:46,112
For years, they've been running jobs in Europe,

5795
09:19:46,190 --> 09:19:47,430
but it's their most recent jobs

5796
09:19:47,483 --> 09:19:49,736
that graduated them to a whole new level.

5797
09:19:49,902 --> 09:19:52,371
Three targets, highly specific.

5798
09:19:52,988 --> 09:19:54,956
The program terminal from an ICBM missile...

5799
09:19:55,616 --> 09:19:57,243
Got a little change?

5800
09:19:57,409 --> 09:19:59,002
Seriously?
You're a millionaire,

5801
09:19:59,161 --> 09:20:00,959
and you're still trying to ask for money?

5802
09:20:01,705 --> 09:20:05,005
That's how you stay a millionaire.

5803
09:20:05,167 --> 09:20:06,293
So what does this all mean?

5804
09:20:06,460 --> 09:20:08,021
Well, our best guess is that Shaw's crew

5805
09:20:08,086 --> 09:20:10,088
is building a Nightshade device.

5806
09:20:10,255 --> 09:20:11,928
Which is?
A tech bomb.

5807
09:20:12,090 --> 09:20:14,593
Designed to block an entire military communication grid

5808
09:20:14,676 --> 09:20:16,019
for 24 hours.

5809
09:20:16,178 --> 09:20:17,851
If you blind a soldier for a single second

5810
09:20:17,930 --> 09:20:19,557
in the middle of a fight, he dies.

5811
09:20:20,057 --> 09:20:22,480
If you blind a country for 24 hours,

5812
09:20:22,559 --> 09:20:23,936
the loss of life is unthinkable.

5813
09:20:25,229 --> 09:20:26,981
This could be worth billions to the right buyer.

5814
09:20:27,064 --> 09:20:28,111
Billions?

5815
09:20:29,274 --> 09:20:30,901
Why don't we just steal that shit?

5816
09:20:30,984 --> 09:20:32,031
Hey, man.

5817
09:20:33,195 --> 09:20:34,697
Which one of these things is a dollar?

5818
09:20:35,405 --> 09:20:36,452
It says something about...

5819
09:20:41,286 --> 09:20:42,412
It's on the house.

5820
09:20:47,042 --> 09:20:49,090
I want you to help me catch Shaw.

5821
09:20:49,920 --> 09:20:51,638
He's only got one piece left that he needs,

5822
09:20:51,797 --> 09:20:53,640
and I intend to stop him before he gets it.

5823
09:20:54,174 --> 09:20:55,892
Now, I know you guys are a family.

5824
09:20:57,135 --> 09:20:59,558
So I'm offering you a chance right now

5825
09:20:59,638 --> 09:21:01,606
to make that family whole again.

5826
09:21:09,147 --> 09:21:10,774
You want to make this family whole again?

5827
09:21:12,484 --> 09:21:14,862
Get us to Letty, we'll get you Shaw,

5828
09:21:14,945 --> 09:21:16,743
full pardons all the way around.

5829
09:21:20,492 --> 09:21:21,960
I can't promise you that.

5830
09:21:22,035 --> 09:21:23,628
Yes, you can.

5831
09:21:28,750 --> 09:21:30,377
That's the deal.

5832
09:21:31,461 --> 09:21:32,929
Take it or leave it.

5833
09:21:38,468 --> 09:21:40,061
You get me Shaw,

5834
09:21:41,471 --> 09:21:43,018
and I'll get your pardons.

5835
09:21:44,683 --> 09:21:46,026
You heard him.

5836
09:21:46,184 --> 09:21:47,731
But this is different.

5837
09:21:47,895 --> 09:21:49,112
We're not dealing with cops,

5838
09:21:49,187 --> 09:21:50,587
we're not dealing with drug dealers.

5839
09:21:51,189 --> 09:21:53,738
This is a whole different level.

5840
09:21:56,320 --> 09:21:58,789
We're getting paid, right?

5841
09:22:10,792 --> 09:22:12,953
Interpol picked up one of Shaw's guys in Moscow.

5842
09:22:12,961 --> 09:22:15,840
I went in, had a little therapy session with him.

5843
09:22:16,089 --> 09:22:18,217
He gave up Shaw's hideout.

5844
09:22:18,675 --> 09:22:21,144
Then why aren't we down there now?

5845
09:22:21,678 --> 09:22:23,100
Well, we weren't invited.

5846
09:22:26,058 --> 09:22:28,277
Hobbs, they're sending in your punching bag.

5847
09:22:28,435 --> 09:22:32,281
He's wired. He's going to give a
positive ID on Shaw before they move in.

5848
09:22:45,702 --> 09:22:48,455
So, the cops just let you go, huh?

5849
09:22:49,539 --> 09:22:53,134
Don't worry, I didn't give them shit.

5850
09:22:53,752 --> 09:22:55,379
Oh, I'm not worried.

5851
09:22:56,129 --> 09:22:57,381
Okay.

5852
09:22:57,839 --> 09:22:59,682
Turn it over for me.

5853
09:23:07,307 --> 09:23:10,026
God, it's amazing.

5854
09:23:11,645 --> 09:23:14,615
The simplest things can cause the biggest problems.

5855
09:23:15,857 --> 09:23:19,236
Good news is, if you swap out a bad part,

5856
09:23:21,113 --> 09:23:23,662
everything runs smooth as silk again.

5857
09:23:26,576 --> 09:23:27,623
Look, Shaw...

5858
09:23:28,203 --> 09:23:29,625
Wait, Shaw! Shaw!

5859
09:23:29,997 --> 09:23:31,374
<i>Shaw!</i>

5860
09:23:31,540 --> 09:23:33,884
I just got confirmation on Shaw.
They're going in.

5861
09:23:50,475 --> 09:23:52,648
Wait, wait, hold up...

5862
09:23:53,812 --> 09:23:56,692
Police scanners are saying alarms are
going off at Interpol headquarters.

5863
09:23:56,773 --> 09:23:57,820
Shit.

5864
09:23:58,191 --> 09:24:00,159
He brought us here so he could take down Interpol.

5865
09:24:00,527 --> 09:24:01,653
This whole thing's a set-up.

5866
09:24:01,820 --> 09:24:03,788
Brian, take the team.
What about you?

5867
09:24:03,989 --> 09:24:06,117
Hobbs and I will wait for Shaw.

5868
09:24:06,283 --> 09:24:08,035
Shaw leads to Letty.

5869
09:24:15,292 --> 09:24:17,294
Come on, you son of a bitch.

5870
09:24:23,383 --> 09:24:24,635
What's this?

5871
09:24:25,677 --> 09:24:27,679
It's your share from the last job.

5872
09:24:30,307 --> 09:24:31,934
<i>You're part of the team, Oakes.</i>

5873
09:24:32,100 --> 09:24:34,102
<i>You do your job, you get paid.</i>

5874
09:24:35,312 --> 09:24:37,531
There's a little extra in there for you.

5875
09:24:38,607 --> 09:24:40,655
Consider it an advance.

5876
09:24:40,817 --> 09:24:42,034
For what?

5877
09:24:43,195 --> 09:24:45,243
The next job, of course.

5878
09:24:46,114 --> 09:24:47,331
Which job?

5879
09:24:48,575 --> 09:24:50,248
The one we're working right now.

5880
09:24:54,289 --> 09:24:55,962
Han, how far are we from Interpol?

5881
09:24:56,124 --> 09:24:57,250
Twelve blocks away.

5882
09:24:57,417 --> 09:24:58,897
You guys, it's a ghost town over here.

5883
09:24:59,002 --> 09:25:00,642
<i>Shaw must have pulled all the cops to him.</i>

5884
09:25:00,670 --> 09:25:03,674
All right, y'all, we're in this shit, so let's go get it.

5885
09:25:07,385 --> 09:25:08,825
It's been fun running with you, mate.

5886
09:25:14,643 --> 09:25:16,145
Stop! Drop the bag!

5887
09:26:00,438 --> 09:26:01,690
There he is.
On it.

5888
09:26:06,069 --> 09:26:08,149
Toretto, it's on you. Straight
ahead, don't lose him.

5889
09:26:08,155 --> 09:26:09,247
Ain't gonna happen.

5890
09:27:11,551 --> 09:27:12,894
Sorry about that, boys.

5891
09:27:26,274 --> 09:27:28,402
Interpol, straight ahead.

5892
09:27:34,741 --> 09:27:36,062
Let's go, guys.
We've got company.

5893
09:27:53,677 --> 09:27:54,849
Let's go, boys.

5894
09:27:56,596 --> 09:27:57,643
Get in! Let's go!

5895
09:28:08,608 --> 09:28:10,531
Hey! We got to move. Now!

5896
09:28:18,159 --> 09:28:21,003
Shaw, we have three cars tailing us.
<i>You know what to do.</i>

5897
09:28:32,841 --> 09:28:34,013
Guys, I got the Rover.

5898
09:28:34,676 --> 09:28:35,848
Okay, I got...

5899
09:28:37,971 --> 09:28:39,473
Whatever the hell that thing is.

5900
09:28:51,693 --> 09:28:53,773
What is that, a hockey puck?

5901
09:29:25,435 --> 09:29:26,561
Oh, shit!

5902
09:29:56,091 --> 09:29:57,593
Approaching rendezvous point.

5903
09:30:02,889 --> 09:30:04,766
Dom! Tej and Roman
are out! Where you at?

5904
09:30:04,933 --> 09:30:05,980
I'm right behind you!

5905
09:30:24,994 --> 09:30:28,089
Stay on track. I'm
taking the contingency.

5906
09:30:31,960 --> 09:30:33,761
Boys, I got eyes on Shaw.
He just made a left.

5907
09:30:33,920 --> 09:30:36,014
- I got right.
<i>- Toretto, make that left!</i>

5908
09:30:46,057 --> 09:30:47,104
No problem.

5909
09:31:58,546 --> 09:31:59,593
Letty.

5910
09:32:16,940 --> 09:32:18,283
Take the wheel.

5911
09:32:51,099 --> 09:32:52,396
Letty.

5912
09:33:08,408 --> 09:33:09,955
<i>This is crazy.</i>

5913
09:33:10,785 --> 09:33:12,662
We are not in Brazil.

5914
09:33:14,080 --> 09:33:16,253
So, now we got cars flying in the air?

5915
09:33:16,416 --> 09:33:19,511
On some 007-type shit?
This is not what we do!

5916
09:33:19,794 --> 09:33:22,013
Man, you really got to check that emotion.

5917
09:33:22,171 --> 09:33:24,970
Your voice just went from
Shaggy to Scooby-Doo.

5918
09:33:25,133 --> 09:33:26,853
"This is not what we..."

5919
09:33:28,136 --> 09:33:30,184
See, man, when a woman starts shooting at you,

5920
09:33:30,346 --> 09:33:33,145
that's a clear sign to back the fuck off!

5921
09:33:34,475 --> 09:33:36,773
We need to get the hell out of Dodge!

5922
09:33:37,895 --> 09:33:40,648
That could have been my forehead, man.

5923
09:33:40,815 --> 09:33:41,862
No.

5924
09:33:41,941 --> 09:33:44,160
That's not as big as your forehead.

5925
09:33:50,950 --> 09:33:52,167
Mia...

5926
09:33:54,162 --> 09:33:56,005
Uh, It's definitely Letty.

5927
09:33:56,164 --> 09:33:58,292
But it's, uh..
It's complicated.

5928
09:33:58,458 --> 09:34:00,176
Letty's alive.

5929
09:34:00,335 --> 09:34:02,178
That's all that matters.

5930
09:34:02,837 --> 09:34:04,931
<i>We have her back, Brian.</i>

5931
09:34:07,175 --> 09:34:11,601
<i>Well, do me a favor and give Jack a kiss goodnight for me.</i>

5932
09:34:11,763 --> 09:34:14,016
Be safe.
I love you, Mia.

5933
09:34:27,945 --> 09:34:30,073
She definitely saw it was you?

5934
09:34:30,865 --> 09:34:32,913
She looked dead at me, Brian.

5935
09:34:34,243 --> 09:34:36,746
Maybe the Letty we once knew is gone, Dom.

5936
09:34:38,623 --> 09:34:41,342
Even though she's alive, maybe she's gone.

5937
09:34:42,377 --> 09:34:45,051
You don't turn your back on family.

5938
09:34:46,631 --> 09:34:49,510
Even when they do.

5939
09:35:09,070 --> 09:35:10,697
Ivory.
Yo.

5940
09:35:11,698 --> 09:35:13,245
It's going to need some repairs.

5941
09:35:13,408 --> 09:35:15,206
No problem, treacle.

5942
09:35:15,910 --> 09:35:17,287
Are you good?

5943
09:35:17,912 --> 09:35:19,164
Yeah.

5944
09:35:20,790 --> 09:35:22,383
Okay, listen up.

5945
09:35:24,961 --> 09:35:26,338
That was a very different breed

5946
09:35:26,421 --> 09:35:28,423
from Hobbs' usual wannabe warriors.

5947
09:35:28,589 --> 09:35:31,217
We need to learn who these people
are, what they're made of.

5948
09:35:31,384 --> 09:35:32,431
Vegh?

5949
09:35:36,013 --> 09:35:37,936
O'Conner, Parker,

5950
09:35:38,808 --> 09:35:41,482
Pearce, Toretto

5951
09:35:41,644 --> 09:35:43,863
and the rest of the team.

5952
09:35:44,522 --> 09:35:46,399
These guys are common criminals.

5953
09:35:46,566 --> 09:35:48,568
Tonight these common criminals were seconds away

5954
09:35:48,651 --> 09:35:50,028
from taking us down.

5955
09:35:50,194 --> 09:35:53,368
Show them the respect they deserve, or it weakens us.

5956
09:35:54,115 --> 09:35:55,867
You might want to see this.

5957
09:36:02,415 --> 09:36:04,213
Ring any bells?

5958
09:36:12,133 --> 09:36:13,225
Yeah.

5959
09:36:15,428 --> 09:36:16,896
That's the guy I shot.

5960
09:36:16,971 --> 09:36:18,018
You look happy.

5961
09:36:18,222 --> 09:36:19,519
I don't remember him.

5962
09:36:19,682 --> 09:36:20,934
That's bullshit.

5963
09:36:21,517 --> 09:36:22,814
We got a problem, guys.

5964
09:36:22,977 --> 09:36:25,696
We got a picture of her with the
guy who almost took you out.

5965
09:36:25,855 --> 09:36:27,573
Klaus, aren't you team muscle?

5966
09:36:28,733 --> 09:36:31,486
Don't make me go over there and make you team pussy.

5967
09:36:33,780 --> 09:36:35,657
She doesn't remember him.

5968
09:36:36,449 --> 09:36:38,451
Names and records aren't enough.

5969
09:36:38,618 --> 09:36:42,919
I want personal information. Get
into their lives, into their minds.

5970
09:36:43,080 --> 09:36:45,924
Find their weaknesses, and we will exploit them.

5971
09:36:52,298 --> 09:36:53,675
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, right.

5972
09:36:55,009 --> 09:36:56,602
This is crazy, man.

5973
09:36:56,761 --> 09:36:58,263
What are you talking about now?

5974
09:36:58,429 --> 09:37:01,057
I'm sitting here looking at these images...

5975
09:37:01,224 --> 09:37:03,773
It's like we're hunting our evil twins.

5976
09:37:03,976 --> 09:37:06,525
Look at this black dude right here, he's handsome.

5977
09:37:06,771 --> 09:37:08,023
Clearly, that's me.

5978
09:37:08,856 --> 09:37:12,030
We got a white Hobbs.
This is Han.

5979
09:37:12,610 --> 09:37:15,659
Tej, it's an African in a beanie.

5980
09:37:15,822 --> 09:37:17,950
That's like
your Mini-Me, man.

5981
09:37:19,367 --> 09:37:20,414
And Brian!

5982
09:37:21,828 --> 09:37:23,876
When did you do this photo shoot?

5983
09:37:24,497 --> 09:37:25,589
I'm just playing, man.

5984
09:37:25,832 --> 09:37:28,130
You know you're the prettiest blonde around here.

5985
09:37:36,300 --> 09:37:38,268
All right, lock it up.
We got two things.

5986
09:37:38,511 --> 09:37:41,481
First off, this is the worst damn
city in the world to commit a crime.

5987
09:37:41,639 --> 09:37:43,312
They got cameras on every street corner.

5988
09:37:43,474 --> 09:37:45,818
I got video footage from CCTV of the raid.

5989
09:37:45,893 --> 09:37:47,227
Let's track that, see where it leads us.

5990
09:37:47,436 --> 09:37:48,983
And secondly, we just got confirmation

5991
09:37:49,063 --> 09:37:50,703
on what Shaw's crew grabbed from Interpol.

5992
09:37:50,773 --> 09:37:51,894
They ripped off the database

5993
09:37:52,024 --> 09:37:54,868
of every location that houses the
final component that they need.

5994
09:37:54,986 --> 09:37:56,033
So where are they at?

5995
09:37:56,112 --> 09:37:57,953
There are over two dozen of them around Europe.

5996
09:37:58,030 --> 09:38:00,158
But the list is only good for 96 hours.

5997
09:38:00,324 --> 09:38:02,292
Which means, wherever Shaw's crew is going to hit next,

5998
09:38:02,451 --> 09:38:04,294
it's going to happen within the next four days.

5999
09:38:04,453 --> 09:38:05,750
They got a window, and so do we.

6000
09:38:05,913 --> 09:38:07,631
- We gotta move.
- Hobbs is right.

6001
09:38:07,832 --> 09:38:09,129
So let's break this down.

6002
09:38:09,208 --> 09:38:10,368
You met them.
What do we know?

6003
09:38:10,459 --> 09:38:12,587
We know they have to be running custom engines.

6004
09:38:12,753 --> 09:38:14,420
You heard that flip car going through those gears.

6005
09:38:14,505 --> 09:38:15,722
Sequential transmission.

6006
09:38:15,798 --> 09:38:17,318
That didn't sound like a normal engine.

6007
09:38:17,425 --> 09:38:19,018
That was a turbo diesel.

6008
09:38:19,093 --> 09:38:20,390
It sounded like something you hear at Le Mans.

6009
09:38:20,520 --> 09:38:21,654
Did you see it take all those hits

6010
09:38:21,679 --> 09:38:22,851
and still stay flat in the corners?

6011
09:38:22,930 --> 09:38:24,102
Yeah, hydraulics.

6012
09:38:24,181 --> 09:38:25,353
Or magnetic suspension.

6013
09:38:25,600 --> 09:38:27,694
Who not only has access to the components,

6014
09:38:27,768 --> 09:38:29,248
but can fabricate something like that?

6015
09:38:29,270 --> 09:38:31,022
Maybe a handful of shops in London.

6016
09:38:31,188 --> 09:38:33,907
Regular tuner shops aren't going to cut it on this one.

6017
09:38:34,066 --> 09:38:35,909
We're going to have to dig deeper than that.

6018
09:38:36,527 --> 09:38:38,404
Han, Gisele, Roman, you're up.

6019
09:38:39,405 --> 09:38:41,453
We find the guy who made that car,

6020
09:38:41,908 --> 09:38:43,000
we find Shaw.

6021
09:38:44,535 --> 09:38:45,707
Let's go.

6022
09:38:46,037 --> 09:38:47,880
I'll help.
Roger that.

6023
09:38:48,039 --> 09:38:51,839
Tej, we're gonna need cars without
computer chips that can be overridden.

6024
09:38:52,668 --> 09:38:54,921
Make sure they're fast.

6025
09:38:55,212 --> 09:38:56,259
I got this.

6026
09:38:56,339 --> 09:38:59,058
I'm already on it, Dom.
I've contacted R&D at DSS.

6027
09:38:59,216 --> 09:39:00,684
Hobbs...

6028
09:39:00,968 --> 09:39:02,595
I said I got this.

6029
09:39:04,764 --> 09:39:07,062
This should be interesting.

6030
09:39:20,279 --> 09:39:21,952
Man, you really got to loosen up.

6031
09:39:22,114 --> 09:39:24,867
You can't just throw a bunch of factory-line
Beemers at people and expect...

6032
09:39:25,034 --> 09:39:26,661
Hey. That car is
a hell of a car.

6033
09:39:26,827 --> 09:39:28,545
You're talking about
twin-turbo V8,

6034
09:39:28,621 --> 09:39:30,669
spitting out 560 ponies, son.

6035
09:39:30,831 --> 09:39:33,550
He reads the brochure.
I'm proud.

6036
09:39:33,709 --> 09:39:35,632
But with cars, you have to customize.

6037
09:39:35,795 --> 09:39:37,638
It's all between you and the car you build.

6038
09:39:37,713 --> 09:39:39,386
It's a bond, it's a commitment.

6039
09:39:39,548 --> 09:39:41,221
It sounds like a marriage.

6040
09:39:41,384 --> 09:39:43,136
Yeah, but with cars, when you trade up,

6041
09:39:43,219 --> 09:39:45,517
they don't take half your shit.

6042
09:39:47,306 --> 09:39:48,353
Jesus.

6043
09:39:48,516 --> 09:39:51,076
With price tags like this, these
cars better be made out of gold.

6044
09:39:54,355 --> 09:39:57,154
You ain't thinking about stealing
these cars, are you, Parker?

6045
09:39:57,400 --> 09:40:00,074
Kitchen help entrance is towards the back.

6046
09:40:01,112 --> 09:40:02,204
Come again?

6047
09:40:02,279 --> 09:40:03,496
I don't mean any offense, gentlemen,

6048
09:40:03,656 --> 09:40:06,409
but you couldn't possibly afford the cars in this auction.

6049
09:40:06,575 --> 09:40:10,751
Substantial lack of gaudy
jewelry, no entourage, no honeys.

6050
09:40:10,913 --> 09:40:12,961
Clearly you're
not a "baller."

6051
09:40:13,207 --> 09:40:14,254
And you.

6052
09:40:15,376 --> 09:40:17,344
Hmm. Shoes, shirt, trousers.

6053
09:40:17,837 --> 09:40:18,884
Functional.

6054
09:40:18,963 --> 09:40:21,011
And your posture, too rigid, no swagger.

6055
09:40:21,132 --> 09:40:23,635
My guess is military.
Take home of 50,000 a year.

6056
09:40:24,135 --> 09:40:25,512
That's U.S.

6057
09:40:25,678 --> 09:40:26,978
Which is not enough to be playing here.

6058
09:40:27,096 --> 09:40:28,939
So, if you're not kitchen help,

6059
09:40:29,015 --> 09:40:31,063
then you must be in the wrong place.

6060
09:40:31,892 --> 09:40:35,317
But please, do finish your champagne.

6061
09:40:39,275 --> 09:40:40,492
Oh, he needs to be taught a lesson.

6062
09:40:40,609 --> 09:40:43,658
Like I said, you ain't stealing these cars.

6063
09:40:44,363 --> 09:40:46,240
I got this.

6064
09:40:50,578 --> 09:40:54,173
All right, this is number five on our list.

6065
09:40:58,544 --> 09:40:59,591
Holy shit.

6066
09:40:59,962 --> 09:41:03,091
What's the dude plan on hunting?
Moby Dick?

6067
09:41:03,257 --> 09:41:04,884
That must be our guy.

6068
09:41:05,051 --> 09:41:07,179
So, how do you all want to play this?

6069
09:41:07,553 --> 09:41:09,226
Han and I got this.

6070
09:41:09,388 --> 09:41:12,813
We go in tight, you let me do all the talking,

6071
09:41:12,975 --> 09:41:14,272
and you all have my back on it.

6072
09:41:14,435 --> 09:41:16,733
There's one thing you boys are forgetting.

6073
09:41:17,438 --> 09:41:19,406
He's a man.

6074
09:41:19,732 --> 09:41:20,984
Let's go.

6075
09:41:22,026 --> 09:41:23,778
"He's a man?"

6076
09:41:24,695 --> 09:41:27,619
You know, she always says that.

6077
09:41:33,120 --> 09:41:38,126
What you're looking at is a
5.45 by 18 FMJ spitzer bullet.

6078
09:41:38,292 --> 09:41:41,262
It's specific to one handgun, the PSM.

6079
09:41:41,420 --> 09:41:44,173
Given that handguns are illegal in the United Kingdom,

6080
09:41:44,340 --> 09:41:46,934
there's very few people that have access to that firearm.

6081
09:41:47,093 --> 09:41:48,640
So if somebody wanted to, say,

6082
09:41:48,719 --> 09:41:50,813
track down where it came from,

6083
09:41:50,971 --> 09:41:53,144
it wouldn't be too hard.

6084
09:41:54,100 --> 09:41:56,180
I was a cop for a lot of years.
Some habits die hard.

6085
09:41:56,644 --> 09:41:59,147
A pawn shop.

6086
09:42:09,406 --> 09:42:10,532
Who sent you?

6087
09:42:11,659 --> 09:42:13,036
Come on, ladies!

6088
09:42:14,036 --> 09:42:16,630
Two hot girls like you don't wander into this neighborhood

6089
09:42:16,705 --> 09:42:18,548
unless I've called the escort service.

6090
09:42:20,042 --> 09:42:21,589
And I haven't, yet, today.

6091
09:42:22,795 --> 09:42:25,844
I don't know, man.
That was disrespectful.

6092
09:42:26,048 --> 09:42:27,641
And I don't like the way she said it,

6093
09:42:27,716 --> 09:42:29,593
like, "He's a man."

6094
09:42:30,052 --> 09:42:32,601
"He's a man?"
So, what are we?

6095
09:42:32,763 --> 09:42:35,266
Come on, she's just doing her job.

6096
09:42:36,058 --> 09:42:38,186
"Doing her job."

6097
09:42:39,186 --> 09:42:40,938
I see what's going on.

6098
09:42:41,730 --> 09:42:42,982
See what?

6099
09:42:43,149 --> 09:42:46,244
You got the little stardust in your eyes, eh?

6100
09:42:46,735 --> 09:42:48,737
Little birds floating around a little bit.

6101
09:42:53,325 --> 09:42:55,748
Uh, you don't want to lease this model.
You want to buy.

6102
09:42:55,911 --> 09:42:57,083
Can you please stop talking?

6103
09:42:57,246 --> 09:43:01,217
No, no, you're in love!
Look at you!

6104
09:43:01,292 --> 09:43:02,669
Just stop.

6105
09:43:03,043 --> 09:43:05,341
You got special plans?
Big day?

6106
09:43:05,421 --> 09:43:06,742
You're going to invite us all out?

6107
09:43:07,089 --> 09:43:08,849
Better make sure you get her a big rock, man,

6108
09:43:08,924 --> 09:43:11,324
'cause she doesn't look like
she'll be that easily impressed.

6109
09:43:11,552 --> 09:43:13,225
And if it's not a big rock,

6110
09:43:13,304 --> 09:43:14,405
you better be big somewhere else.

6111
09:43:14,555 --> 09:43:16,808
You know what I'm talking about.

6112
09:43:17,474 --> 09:43:20,398
That's why all your girlfriends wear so much bling, huh?

6113
09:43:23,022 --> 09:43:24,222
We're looking for information.

6114
09:43:24,356 --> 09:43:26,324
You're looking for information?
About what?

6115
09:43:26,483 --> 09:43:29,487
Information about cars.

6116
09:43:30,279 --> 09:43:32,623
In particular, two you designed recently.

6117
09:43:32,781 --> 09:43:35,660
Ramp cars.
Low slung, skeletal frames.

6118
09:43:35,826 --> 09:43:39,080
We'd be very interested to find the man who bought those.

6119
09:43:39,163 --> 09:43:40,210
Why should I help you?

6120
09:43:40,289 --> 09:43:41,632
Because we're asking you nicely.

6121
09:43:41,707 --> 09:43:43,129
Because you're asking me nicely?

6122
09:43:43,292 --> 09:43:46,045
What can you offer that I can't
get from a thousand other girls?

6123
09:43:46,378 --> 09:43:48,130
Hmm?

6124
09:43:51,300 --> 09:43:52,347
Stop! Stop!

6125
09:44:00,142 --> 09:44:02,315
You look like a man who likes it rough.

6126
09:44:03,229 --> 09:44:07,234
My friend here can give you heights of pain

6127
09:44:07,399 --> 09:44:10,152
you've never experienced before.

6128
09:44:12,154 --> 09:44:13,201
Do we have a deal?

6129
09:44:14,073 --> 09:44:16,701
Deal! Deal! Deal!

6130
09:44:16,867 --> 09:44:17,993
I take it back.

6131
09:44:19,495 --> 09:44:21,088
Me likey.

6132
09:44:35,010 --> 09:44:36,057
Stop, stop, stop.

6133
09:44:36,220 --> 09:44:38,769
So this is how you "got this?"
By buying all of his cars?

6134
09:44:38,931 --> 09:44:40,933
What good is having millions of dollars in the bank

6135
09:44:41,100 --> 09:44:42,443
if you don't spend any of it?

6136
09:44:42,685 --> 09:44:44,437
But don't worry about that.
Watch this.

6137
09:44:45,437 --> 09:44:48,566
Mr. Parker, again, can I
just express our gratitude

6138
09:44:48,732 --> 09:44:51,076
and say how much we appreciate your business.

6139
09:44:51,235 --> 09:44:53,863
If there's ever anything else
you need, you just have to ask.

6140
09:44:53,946 --> 09:44:55,038
Anything?
Mmm-hmm.

6141
09:44:55,114 --> 09:44:57,788
Now that you mention it,
my swagger-less friend here,

6142
09:44:57,950 --> 09:45:00,578
he really likes that shirt you have on.

6143
09:45:01,245 --> 09:45:02,713
Uh, this shirt?

6144
09:45:03,038 --> 09:45:04,130
That shirt.

6145
09:45:04,290 --> 09:45:07,134
I'm not entirely sure that this shirt
would fit your friend.

6146
09:45:07,209 --> 09:45:08,301
It will fit.

6147
09:45:08,377 --> 09:45:10,050
He needs a shirt that's a little less...

6148
09:45:10,129 --> 09:45:11,221
Functional.

6149
09:45:11,297 --> 09:45:12,970
That's it, functional.

6150
09:45:16,385 --> 09:45:17,602
Okay.

6151
09:45:22,391 --> 09:45:24,143
I'll hold that.
Thank you.

6152
09:45:24,393 --> 09:45:25,940
Come on, man, time is money.

6153
09:45:26,103 --> 09:45:27,229
Yes, doing my best.

6154
09:45:30,316 --> 09:45:33,115
Damn, you need some hedge clippers for that shit.

6155
09:45:33,485 --> 09:45:36,659
Well, if that will be all...

6156
09:45:36,905 --> 09:45:38,828
And the pants, too.

6157
09:45:46,081 --> 09:45:47,173
Right.

6158
09:45:47,916 --> 09:45:50,135
While you're at it, let me get that watch.

6159
09:45:50,294 --> 09:45:51,511
I like that watch.

6160
09:46:01,764 --> 09:46:03,107
This is for you.

6161
09:46:03,265 --> 09:46:05,188
And this is for you.
Thank you.

6162
09:46:05,684 --> 09:46:08,187
Good day, gentlemen.
Thank you.

6163
09:46:14,860 --> 09:46:16,453
So I, um,

6164
09:46:16,528 --> 09:46:18,781
I got the information in here.

6165
09:46:30,459 --> 09:46:33,713
May I ask why you're looking for Shaw?

6166
09:46:34,546 --> 09:46:36,548
He took something of ours.

6167
09:46:37,466 --> 09:46:39,218
<i>We'd like to talk to him about it.</i>

6168
09:46:39,385 --> 09:46:41,479
<i>Let's see what we've got.</i>

6169
09:46:55,317 --> 09:46:57,240
All right.
What do you want?

6170
09:46:57,403 --> 09:46:59,656
They say if someone's looking for a Russian gun,

6171
09:46:59,822 --> 09:47:00,914
you're the man to see.

6172
09:47:01,031 --> 09:47:03,409
Oh, they do, do they?

6173
09:47:07,538 --> 09:47:08,915
What do you want, mate?

6174
09:47:16,630 --> 09:47:18,553
That might be a bad idea.

6175
09:47:23,303 --> 09:47:25,852
I'm looking for the owner of this.
I don't know.

6176
09:47:28,934 --> 09:47:30,231
Take a closer look.

6177
09:47:30,394 --> 09:47:32,442
About a week ago, a girl came in,

6178
09:47:32,521 --> 09:47:33,921
bought guns, ammo, everything I had.

6179
09:47:34,064 --> 09:47:35,737
A girl?

6180
09:47:35,899 --> 09:47:37,151
What did she look like?

6181
09:47:37,317 --> 09:47:38,660
Tough chick, dark hair.

6182
09:47:39,236 --> 09:47:40,328
Mean streak.

6183
09:47:40,487 --> 09:47:42,740
Word is she's a street racer.

6184
09:47:42,865 --> 09:47:43,912
Where can we find her?

6185
09:47:44,032 --> 09:47:45,659
How do I know?
Do I look like a racer?

6186
09:47:47,744 --> 09:47:50,714
No. You don't.

6187
09:47:58,172 --> 09:47:59,219
Take care, guys.

6188
09:48:06,680 --> 09:48:07,772
Oh, shit.

6189
09:48:23,447 --> 09:48:24,539
Sorry, girls.

6190
09:48:29,953 --> 09:48:31,205
Let's go!

6191
09:49:20,462 --> 09:49:21,554
Hold on.

6192
09:49:21,630 --> 09:49:24,474
Stay with me. Stay with me.

6193
09:49:24,633 --> 09:49:25,976
Tell me where to find Shaw,

6194
09:49:26,093 --> 09:49:28,095
and I'll make him pay for this.

6195
09:49:35,269 --> 09:49:36,862
Braga...

6196
09:50:09,469 --> 09:50:10,812
Ow!

6197
09:50:28,572 --> 09:50:30,040
Hey, you!

6198
09:50:30,198 --> 09:50:31,245
Stop right there!

6199
09:51:59,121 --> 09:52:00,623
You go!
No, you go!

6200
09:53:24,664 --> 09:53:27,008
No one needs to know about this.

6201
09:53:27,626 --> 09:53:29,003
No one.

6202
09:53:43,141 --> 09:53:45,394
We lost Ivory.

6203
09:53:45,560 --> 09:53:47,153
He's gone.

6204
09:53:47,813 --> 09:53:48,860
Thanks.

6205
09:53:54,069 --> 09:53:55,161
That's it?

6206
09:53:55,695 --> 09:53:58,539
If ivory's dead, he made a mistake.

6207
09:54:00,534 --> 09:54:02,332
If you make a mistake, you pay the price.

6208
09:54:06,373 --> 09:54:08,046
That's a great eulogy, Shaw.

6209
09:54:09,251 --> 09:54:10,924
Are you going to give the same speech

6210
09:54:11,002 --> 09:54:12,845
for the rest of us when we go out?

6211
09:54:31,189 --> 09:54:34,693
You're the last one I'd have pegged to be sentimental.

6212
09:54:39,197 --> 09:54:40,915
I like you, Letty.

6213
09:54:42,075 --> 09:54:45,545
I dare say I even feel a certain warmth towards you.

6214
09:54:45,871 --> 09:54:47,151
When I found you in the hospital,

6215
09:54:47,205 --> 09:54:49,628
and you couldn't remember anything,

6216
09:54:50,750 --> 09:54:51,922
I said to myself,

6217
09:54:54,087 --> 09:54:56,135
"This girl has a gift."

6218
09:54:57,257 --> 09:54:59,555
"She's a blank page."

6219
09:55:00,635 --> 09:55:04,310
And that made me feel somewhat protective toward you.

6220
09:55:05,599 --> 09:55:08,728
If something happened to you, for instance,

6221
09:55:08,894 --> 09:55:12,148
I think I might find that slightly harder to bear.

6222
09:55:15,066 --> 09:55:17,068
What I'm saying is,

6223
09:55:17,652 --> 09:55:20,781
I would hate to see you

6224
09:55:20,947 --> 09:55:23,166
make a mistake.

6225
09:55:30,415 --> 09:55:32,258
I'm going to get some air.

6226
09:56:00,153 --> 09:56:02,155
What the hell happened?
We met Dom's girlfriend.

6227
09:56:02,697 --> 09:56:04,620
She's lovely.

6228
09:56:04,783 --> 09:56:06,660
Are you all right?
Yeah.

6229
09:56:06,826 --> 09:56:09,124
Tej, what have you got?
Footage, CCTV? Talk to me.

6230
09:56:09,287 --> 09:56:10,789
I just went through all of it.

6231
09:56:10,956 --> 09:56:13,709
Believe it or not, everywhere Shaw's
team is, the cameras are down.

6232
09:56:13,875 --> 09:56:15,798
That's a hell of a coincidence.

6233
09:56:16,628 --> 09:56:19,677
All right, we're going to pay
CCTV a little visit. Let's roll.

6234
09:56:20,298 --> 09:56:21,470
What is that?

6235
09:56:21,633 --> 09:56:24,011
That is a new toy for you.

6236
09:56:24,177 --> 09:56:25,349
So, what happened?

6237
09:56:25,512 --> 09:56:28,140
Shaw's goons showed up and started shooting up the place.

6238
09:56:28,306 --> 09:56:29,649
But we got something big.

6239
09:56:29,808 --> 09:56:31,230
What?
Braga.

6240
09:56:32,644 --> 09:56:34,567
He's working with Shaw.

6241
09:56:36,147 --> 09:56:37,239
What are you talking about?

6242
09:56:37,399 --> 09:56:40,152
It's true. That phone's filled
with coded payment transactions

6243
09:56:40,318 --> 09:56:42,161
that lead straight to Braga's cartel.

6244
09:56:42,320 --> 09:56:43,822
Who the hell is Braga?

6245
09:56:43,989 --> 09:56:46,833
He ran one of the biggest cartels in Mexico.

6246
09:56:46,992 --> 09:56:48,369
And my old boss.

6247
09:56:49,035 --> 09:56:50,833
We used codes just like that

6248
09:56:50,912 --> 09:56:52,013
to move money out of the country.

6249
09:56:52,163 --> 09:56:53,255
It all makes sense.

6250
09:56:53,915 --> 09:56:56,009
Braga was running Letty, now he's working with Shaw.

6251
09:56:56,167 --> 09:56:57,534
It would explain how the two of them met.

6252
09:56:57,544 --> 09:56:58,761
Okay, so you all know all this information

6253
09:56:58,837 --> 09:57:00,180
about him, where do we find him?

6254
09:57:00,255 --> 09:57:02,178
He's sitting in a prison in Los Angeles.

6255
09:57:02,257 --> 09:57:03,600
How do you know that?

6256
09:57:05,719 --> 09:57:07,721
Brian put him there.

6257
09:57:07,887 --> 09:57:09,821
All right, so this is the break we were looking for.

6258
09:57:09,848 --> 09:57:12,101
If the two of them were working together,

6259
09:57:12,183 --> 09:57:13,685
Braga will know what Shaw's up to.

6260
09:57:13,893 --> 09:57:15,145
I'm going to pay him a visit.

6261
09:57:15,228 --> 09:57:16,855
Are you serious right now?

6262
09:57:17,230 --> 09:57:19,403
Think about what you're saying.

6263
09:57:19,691 --> 09:57:21,193
You're wanted, Brian.

6264
09:57:21,693 --> 09:57:25,197
The moment you step foot off that plane, it's a wrap.

6265
09:57:25,697 --> 09:57:26,869
You're not coming back.

6266
09:57:27,032 --> 09:57:29,376
"Coming back?" How are you
going to get in the country?

6267
09:57:29,534 --> 09:57:31,411
Let me worry about that.

6268
09:57:39,044 --> 09:57:40,717
This is on me.

6269
09:57:41,880 --> 09:57:44,224
I'm the one that served her up to Braga.

6270
09:57:45,050 --> 09:57:48,054
I'm the one that gets to make it right.

6271
09:57:50,638 --> 09:57:52,481
Let me make it right.

6272
09:57:54,601 --> 09:57:55,898
Be careful.

6273
09:58:03,318 --> 09:58:05,238
He's ready to see you now.
Right this way.

6274
09:58:08,656 --> 09:58:11,079
Thank you for seeing us. I won't
take up much of your time.

6275
09:58:11,242 --> 09:58:12,835
My men were attacked earlier today.

6276
09:58:12,994 --> 09:58:14,416
I'm going to need to see all cameras

6277
09:58:14,496 --> 09:58:16,919
in and around Waterloo station.

6278
09:58:17,457 --> 09:58:19,630
Will somebody tell Captain America here

6279
09:58:19,751 --> 09:58:21,594
that requires clearance?

6280
09:58:25,799 --> 09:58:27,096
Terry.

6281
09:58:27,842 --> 09:58:31,437
Bring up cameras 58 through 62, earlier today.

6282
09:58:34,516 --> 09:58:36,644
They've been down for maintenance all morning.

6283
09:58:37,352 --> 09:58:38,444
Sorry.

6284
09:58:38,770 --> 09:58:41,865
Okay. Well, we appreciate
your help. Thank you.

6285
09:58:46,486 --> 09:58:48,409
You know what I find very interesting

6286
09:58:48,571 --> 09:58:51,370
is Interpol was attacked recently as well.

6287
09:58:51,533 --> 09:58:53,752
Those cameras were down, too.
Didn't catch a thing.

6288
09:58:54,244 --> 09:58:55,370
Nothing.

6289
09:58:55,829 --> 09:58:57,456
Now, that means either one of two things.

6290
09:58:57,505 --> 09:58:59,106
Either means that your maintenance schedule here

6291
09:58:59,124 --> 09:59:01,218
aligns perfectly with their escape route

6292
09:59:01,292 --> 09:59:03,886
or it means that someone here is working with them.

6293
09:59:04,254 --> 09:59:06,848
And that's just ridiculous.

6294
09:59:06,890 --> 09:59:08,024
Because there ain't no way in hell

6295
09:59:08,049 --> 09:59:10,427
anybody here would be working for them.

6296
09:59:10,718 --> 09:59:12,079
Particularly you, ain't that right?

6297
09:59:12,262 --> 09:59:14,264
No, no, that's ridiculous.

6298
09:59:14,430 --> 09:59:15,898
That is ridiculous.

6299
09:59:16,057 --> 09:59:18,856
I'm going to need direct access to your live feed

6300
09:59:18,935 --> 09:59:19,982
citywide.

6301
09:59:20,103 --> 09:59:23,403
And I also strongly suggest
that you put a hold on any more

6302
09:59:23,565 --> 09:59:24,737
"maintenance."

6303
09:59:24,899 --> 09:59:26,742
Yeah, of course.

6304
09:59:27,068 --> 09:59:29,241
We appreciate your help.
Thank you so much.

6305
09:59:47,922 --> 09:59:50,266
Well, well, well.

6306
09:59:50,425 --> 09:59:52,598
The orange in that really makes your eyes pop.

6307
09:59:59,601 --> 10:00:01,319
Thanks, fellas.

6308
10:00:01,477 --> 10:00:03,104
Tell me something, O'Conner,

6309
10:00:03,271 --> 10:00:05,114
how is it you keep running around the world,

6310
10:00:05,190 --> 10:00:06,430
breaking every law known to man,

6311
10:00:06,441 --> 10:00:09,160
and yet here I am, putting my job on the line for you?

6312
10:00:09,485 --> 10:00:12,284
You'll feel a lot better once you get
the credit for taking down Shaw.

6313
10:00:13,156 --> 10:00:15,158
Oh, I'm tempted to settle for you.

6314
10:00:15,783 --> 10:00:17,831
Well, you know what they say, Stasiak,

6315
10:00:17,994 --> 10:00:19,595
if you want the
career-changing big fish,

6316
10:00:19,621 --> 10:00:21,321
you got to be willing to put on the big boy panties

6317
10:00:21,372 --> 10:00:23,466
and sail out to the deep water.

6318
10:00:23,625 --> 10:00:25,127
You're an asshole, you know that?

6319
10:00:30,006 --> 10:00:32,805
I missed you, too, man.
I really missed you.

6320
10:00:34,469 --> 10:00:37,389
<i>I got you admitted into
Victorville to do whatever you got to do.</i>

6321
10:00:37,472 --> 10:00:39,019
<i>It's a 24-hour hold.</i>

6322
10:00:39,182 --> 10:00:40,855
<i>You need to be out
of there by 9:00 a.m.</i>

6323
10:00:41,017 --> 10:00:44,362
<i>That's when Forensics will run your
fingerprints through the national database.</i>

6324
10:00:44,520 --> 10:00:46,318
<i>That program will match you</i>

6325
10:00:46,481 --> 10:00:48,199
<i>and when they find out who you really are,</i>

6326
10:00:48,316 --> 10:00:49,989
<i>I won't be able to get you back out.</i>

6327
10:00:50,652 --> 10:00:52,199
<i>We're taking life in prison.</i>

6328
10:00:59,827 --> 10:01:00,999
Cute kid.

6329
10:01:04,999 --> 10:01:09,505
So, I found out Braga's being held in cell block D3.

6330
10:01:09,671 --> 10:01:10,718
That's solitary.

6331
10:01:10,880 --> 10:01:13,349
I only had enough juice to get you in Gen Pop.

6332
10:01:13,716 --> 10:01:17,016
So you're going to have to do
something to get his attention.

6333
10:01:18,012 --> 10:01:19,013
Sorry about this, man.

6334
10:01:19,097 --> 10:01:20,189
Sorry about what?

6335
10:01:31,234 --> 10:01:32,736
Again?

6336
10:01:40,910 --> 10:01:43,379
Big Brother's about to go live.

6337
10:01:47,917 --> 10:01:50,921
Damn, you can't flick a booger in
London without somebody noticing.

6338
10:01:54,716 --> 10:01:57,390
Hey! Don't touch that. That's
nothing to play with, man.

6339
10:01:57,552 --> 10:01:58,599
What's the problem?

6340
10:01:58,720 --> 10:02:00,768
That's high-tensile
titanium cable.

6341
10:02:01,222 --> 10:02:02,314
What does that mean?

6342
10:02:02,390 --> 10:02:04,392
That's what they use to anchor
buildings and hold up bridges,

6343
10:02:04,559 --> 10:02:06,561
stuff you know nothing about!

6344
10:02:06,728 --> 10:02:09,231
See, now, their version, it works cool,

6345
10:02:09,397 --> 10:02:12,446
but mine, masterpiece.

6346
10:02:12,608 --> 10:02:15,452
See, I reversed the gears, torqued the motor

6347
10:02:15,903 --> 10:02:17,780
and added this tank to the back.

6348
10:02:18,406 --> 10:02:19,623
That makes it even sweeter.

6349
10:02:19,782 --> 10:02:20,829
It does.

6350
10:02:20,908 --> 10:02:22,125
It's not dummy-proof.

6351
10:02:22,285 --> 10:02:24,413
Man, I've been known
to handle big guns. Relax.

6352
10:02:24,746 --> 10:02:26,746
You've been known to
handle that big-ass head.

6353
10:02:26,831 --> 10:02:29,505
Dom, I did some checking, asked around,

6354
10:02:29,667 --> 10:02:31,544
got the location of a street race tonight.

6355
10:02:32,879 --> 10:02:35,428
Four speed Camaro SS big block.

6356
10:02:36,549 --> 10:02:37,596
You like it?

6357
10:02:38,259 --> 10:02:39,260
Nice color.

6358
10:03:28,601 --> 10:03:30,478
Brian O'Conner.

6359
10:03:30,645 --> 10:03:32,773
That was quite an entrance.

6360
10:03:38,945 --> 10:03:40,993
You put a lot of these men in here.

6361
10:03:41,447 --> 10:03:44,291
What? You didn't think
one would recognize you?

6362
10:03:46,994 --> 10:03:49,838
I've kept tabs on you, you know.

6363
10:03:50,456 --> 10:03:52,800
You've been having a lot of fun out there.

6364
10:03:52,959 --> 10:03:56,634
Good cop gone bad, Rio de Janeiro.

6365
10:03:56,796 --> 10:03:59,140
It's exciting when you go criminal, isn't it?

6366
10:03:59,298 --> 10:04:02,347
Too bad you didn't do it earlier,
you could have worked for me.

6367
10:04:02,510 --> 10:04:04,137
Like Letty Ortiz?

6368
10:04:06,347 --> 10:04:08,349
So tell me something, because I buried her.

6369
10:04:08,516 --> 10:04:10,143
Yeah? You did?

6370
10:04:10,309 --> 10:04:12,983
You buried something, I couldn't
tell you who or what it was.

6371
10:04:14,313 --> 10:04:16,486
I know she's running with Owen Shaw.

6372
10:04:17,817 --> 10:04:19,819
Still playing cop, huh?

6373
10:04:20,653 --> 10:04:23,076
Trust me, this is way above your pay grade.

6374
10:04:24,991 --> 10:04:26,208
Humor me, please.

6375
10:04:27,326 --> 10:04:30,830
Well, you're a dead man walking, what does it matter?

6376
10:04:32,331 --> 10:04:34,174
I ran everything for Shaw.

6377
10:04:34,333 --> 10:04:37,837
Drugs, guns, money, women.

6378
10:04:38,004 --> 10:04:40,848
He taught me to think global when I was just local.

6379
10:04:41,007 --> 10:04:42,509
He made me a wealthy man.

6380
10:04:42,675 --> 10:04:44,723
And this guy didn't just have the cartels working for him.

6381
10:04:44,886 --> 10:04:49,517
He had the CIA, DEA, everyone in his pocket.

6382
10:04:49,682 --> 10:04:51,855
He knew what was going to happen before they did.

6383
10:04:52,018 --> 10:04:56,524
In fact, he even knew when some
wet-behind-the-ears FBI agent

6384
10:04:56,689 --> 10:04:59,738
<i>decided to put some informant in my cartel.</i>

6385
10:05:00,822 --> 10:05:03,450
The minute you put Letty undercover, she was dead, bro.

6386
10:05:03,722 --> 10:05:05,224
But she survived.

6387
10:05:05,557 --> 10:05:07,230
That girl is one tough bitch.

6388
10:05:07,892 --> 10:05:10,065
Shaw found her in a hospital two days later.

6389
10:05:10,228 --> 10:05:12,447
He went to finish the job.

6390
10:05:12,605 --> 10:05:14,607
And he didn't
kill her. Why?

6391
10:05:15,400 --> 10:05:17,402
She had no memory.

6392
10:05:18,361 --> 10:05:20,079
Perfect girl, huh?

6393
10:05:22,073 --> 10:05:24,201
You're lucky this door's between us.

6394
10:05:30,540 --> 10:05:32,884
What happened to Letty is on your head.

6395
10:06:18,088 --> 10:06:20,056
Look at me! Look at me.

6396
10:06:21,424 --> 10:06:23,222
You won't do it.

6397
10:06:24,969 --> 10:06:26,471
What is Shaw up to?

6398
10:06:26,638 --> 10:06:29,562
How do you think he knows your
next move before you make it?

6399
10:06:29,724 --> 10:06:31,317
He's got eyes on you.

6400
10:06:31,476 --> 10:06:33,069
Think about it.

6401
10:06:37,273 --> 10:06:39,696
The only way you get close to Shaw

6402
10:06:39,859 --> 10:06:41,406
is if he wants you there.

6403
10:08:25,632 --> 10:08:27,634
You've got some serious balls, man.

6404
10:08:27,967 --> 10:08:29,344
I've been told.

6405
10:08:30,303 --> 10:08:32,226
You know, you're lucky I missed my shot.

6406
10:08:33,014 --> 10:08:34,391
I think you hit your mark.

6407
10:08:34,557 --> 10:08:35,809
Really?

6408
10:08:36,684 --> 10:08:37,810
What is it with you?

6409
10:08:37,977 --> 10:08:39,820
Do you got a death wish or something?

6410
10:08:39,979 --> 10:08:41,652
If that's what it takes.

6411
10:08:41,814 --> 10:08:43,691
I just want to race.

6412
10:08:45,068 --> 10:08:46,536
You might lose your car.

6413
10:08:50,573 --> 10:08:52,075
Let's do it.

6414
10:08:52,492 --> 10:08:54,335
Your funeral.

6415
10:08:54,994 --> 10:08:57,167
Ride or die, remember?

6416
10:09:05,838 --> 10:09:07,010
Listen up!

6417
10:09:07,715 --> 10:09:10,218
Out here, we're used to getting what we want.

6418
10:09:10,385 --> 10:09:12,729
This is London, baby.

6419
10:09:13,096 --> 10:09:14,598
But remember,

6420
10:09:15,348 --> 10:09:17,771
don't bite the bait.

6421
10:09:17,934 --> 10:09:19,561
Are you ready?

6422
10:09:20,520 --> 10:09:22,067
Ready?
Ready.

6423
10:09:25,733 --> 10:09:27,076
Steady.

6424
10:09:30,697 --> 10:09:31,744
Go!

6425
10:10:23,416 --> 10:10:24,759
Just like old times.

6426
10:11:12,965 --> 10:11:13,966
This guy is crazy.

6427
10:11:53,714 --> 10:11:55,057
You got to be kidding me.

6428
10:12:25,705 --> 10:12:27,207
You're still upshifting early.

6429
10:12:27,373 --> 10:12:29,796
I do that so you brake.

6430
10:12:30,710 --> 10:12:33,805
You lose traction and the back end kicks out.

6431
10:12:34,714 --> 10:12:35,715
I noticed.

6432
10:12:37,300 --> 10:12:41,225
Look, just because you know how I
ride, doesn't mean you know me.

6433
10:12:42,305 --> 10:12:44,148
You know what they say where we're from?

6434
10:12:45,475 --> 10:12:47,898
Show me how you drive, I'll show you who you are.

6435
10:12:49,896 --> 10:12:51,398
V8.

6436
10:12:52,398 --> 10:12:54,901
You never could resist American muscle.

6437
10:12:59,071 --> 10:13:00,414
Nice scar.

6438
10:13:05,578 --> 10:13:08,752
You never could keep yourself out of trouble, either.

6439
10:13:12,251 --> 10:13:13,753
What else do you know about me?

6440
10:13:14,754 --> 10:13:16,256
About you?

6441
10:13:18,758 --> 10:13:20,260
Everything.

6442
10:13:27,099 --> 10:13:29,272
Like this scar.

6443
10:13:29,435 --> 10:13:33,030
You got that the first night we met.
You were 15.

6444
10:13:33,189 --> 10:13:35,442
First street race.

6445
10:13:36,275 --> 10:13:40,200
Some kid trying to show off lost control of his car,

6446
10:13:40,363 --> 10:13:42,957
wiped out right next to you.

6447
10:13:43,115 --> 10:13:45,459
You're lucky you didn't lose your arm.

6448
10:13:45,618 --> 10:13:47,040
And let me guess,

6449
10:13:47,787 --> 10:13:49,630
you saved me.

6450
10:13:49,789 --> 10:13:51,291
No.

6451
10:13:51,958 --> 10:13:54,131
I was the kid showing off.

6452
10:13:57,296 --> 10:13:58,639
And here...

6453
10:14:05,137 --> 10:14:06,980
Boyle Heights.

6454
10:14:07,974 --> 10:14:12,070
You were fleeing with my little sister
Mia and got trapped in a corner.

6455
10:14:13,062 --> 10:14:15,485
And you thought it was a good idea

6456
10:14:15,648 --> 10:14:19,323
to ride your Torino Cobra through a retaining wall.

6457
10:14:21,988 --> 10:14:25,743
All right, how about this one?

6458
10:14:29,328 --> 10:14:32,502
That's the last time we were together.

6459
10:14:34,000 --> 10:14:36,002
In the DR.

6460
10:14:37,003 --> 10:14:39,597
You wanted to go for a night swim.

6461
10:14:40,923 --> 10:14:43,176
You cut yourself on the reef.

6462
10:14:43,342 --> 10:14:45,265
I followed you.

6463
10:14:47,013 --> 10:14:49,857
I even got this scar to match.

6464
10:14:52,351 --> 10:14:54,524
Look, I don't know why you're here,

6465
10:14:54,687 --> 10:14:57,531
but I really think you're over your head.

6466
10:15:05,948 --> 10:15:08,042
I'm here for you.

6467
10:15:12,246 --> 10:15:14,340
That girl you remember,

6468
10:15:16,167 --> 10:15:17,840
it's not me.

6469
10:15:19,462 --> 10:15:22,090
Not from what I just saw.

6470
10:15:24,300 --> 10:15:25,973
Like it or not,

6471
10:15:28,137 --> 10:15:29,810
you're still the same girl.

6472
10:15:33,017 --> 10:15:35,315
I saw it out there.

6473
10:15:36,979 --> 10:15:39,152
I see it right now.

6474
10:15:41,984 --> 10:15:43,031
I got to go.

6475
10:15:45,279 --> 10:15:47,156
Hey.

6476
10:15:56,540 --> 10:15:59,214
It belongs to you.

6477
10:16:33,661 --> 10:16:35,413
There she goes,

6478
10:16:35,579 --> 10:16:37,047
leaving you again.

6479
10:16:39,166 --> 10:16:41,009
Bloody fickle, that one.

6480
10:16:42,169 --> 10:16:44,263
You want bloody?
We could do bloody.

6481
10:16:47,758 --> 10:16:49,260
A street kid,

6482
10:16:50,261 --> 10:16:53,060
starts out stealing
DVD players in East L.A.,

6483
10:16:54,724 --> 10:16:58,103
ends up heisting $100 million in Rio.

6484
10:16:58,436 --> 10:16:59,938
Not bad, huh?

6485
10:17:00,104 --> 10:17:02,106
It's a good story, isn't it?

6486
10:17:03,274 --> 10:17:05,117
Almost inspiring.

6487
10:17:06,444 --> 10:17:08,913
See, what I couldn't fathom is

6488
10:17:09,363 --> 10:17:11,536
why he's not relaxing on a beach somewhere

6489
10:17:11,615 --> 10:17:14,118
with that cute little Brazilian number.

6490
10:17:15,077 --> 10:17:20,083
Instead, he's working with a two-bit
government hack like Hobbs.

6491
10:17:22,793 --> 10:17:24,591
And then I realized,

6492
10:17:27,047 --> 10:17:28,640
he has a weak spot.

6493
10:17:30,384 --> 10:17:32,807
We all got a weak spot.

6494
10:17:33,637 --> 10:17:34,889
You know,

6495
10:17:35,473 --> 10:17:39,569
when I was young, my brother always used to say,

6496
10:17:39,727 --> 10:17:42,276
"Every man has
to have a code."

6497
10:17:43,230 --> 10:17:44,482
Mine?

6498
10:17:44,982 --> 10:17:46,450
Precision.

6499
10:17:47,777 --> 10:17:51,657
A team is nothing but pieces you
switch out until you get the job done.

6500
10:17:51,822 --> 10:17:53,074
It's efficient.

6501
10:17:53,657 --> 10:17:54,954
It works.

6502
10:17:55,993 --> 10:17:57,290
But you?

6503
10:17:59,830 --> 10:18:01,673
You're loyal to a fault.

6504
10:18:02,416 --> 10:18:04,760
Your code is about family.

6505
10:18:06,045 --> 10:18:09,549
And that's great in the holidays,
but it makes you predictable.

6506
10:18:09,673 --> 10:18:12,176
And in our line of work, predictable means vulnerable.

6507
10:18:12,343 --> 10:18:15,938
And that means I can reach out
and break you whenever I want.

6508
10:18:16,305 --> 10:18:19,149
At least when I go, I'll know what it's for.

6509
10:18:20,684 --> 10:18:22,027
Well,

6510
10:18:23,103 --> 10:18:25,026
at least you have a code.

6511
10:18:27,525 --> 10:18:28,868
Most men don't.

6512
10:18:32,863 --> 10:18:34,160
So.

6513
10:18:35,366 --> 10:18:37,164
I'm going to give you a chance.

6514
10:18:38,702 --> 10:18:40,796
Take your crew and walk away.

6515
10:18:40,955 --> 10:18:43,549
That's the only way you're going to keep your family safe.

6516
10:18:46,168 --> 10:18:49,047
Your brother never told you never
to threaten a man's family?

6517
10:18:50,881 --> 10:18:53,134
It's a pretty stupid thing to do.

6518
10:18:55,302 --> 10:18:57,725
But I'll make it simple for you.

6519
10:18:59,056 --> 10:19:02,060
I walk away when she walks away.

6520
10:19:03,561 --> 10:19:04,813
Well, then,

6521
10:19:06,897 --> 10:19:09,867
it appears this inspiring tale has come to an end.

6522
10:19:17,908 --> 10:19:19,581
If that's the way it has to go.

6523
10:19:26,667 --> 10:19:28,669
Let me guess...

6524
10:19:30,004 --> 10:19:31,051
Hobbs.

6525
10:19:34,425 --> 10:19:37,019
Come on, you son of a bitch.

6526
10:19:37,761 --> 10:19:39,729
The "two-bit
government hack."

6527
10:19:47,104 --> 10:19:48,777
See you around, Toretto.

6528
10:19:48,939 --> 10:19:50,441
You can bet on it.

6529
10:20:05,205 --> 10:20:08,300
Riley, Shaw's leaving Battersea, heading southeast.

6530
10:20:08,459 --> 10:20:10,132
Have Tej track him
on his live feed. Go.

6531
10:20:11,754 --> 10:20:12,855
You know what would have happened

6532
10:20:12,880 --> 10:20:15,508
if I didn't put that tracker in your car?

6533
10:20:17,885 --> 10:20:19,057
This one?

6534
10:20:26,393 --> 10:20:30,318
You know, this just got me one step closer to Shaw.

6535
10:20:30,814 --> 10:20:32,657
For what it's worth, Toretto,

6536
10:20:33,067 --> 10:20:35,820
I hope it gets you closer to what you want, too.

6537
10:20:51,835 --> 10:20:53,678
This better have been worth it.

6538
10:20:54,171 --> 10:20:56,139
More than you'll ever know.

6539
10:21:43,012 --> 10:21:44,229
Pretty.

6540
10:21:49,018 --> 10:21:50,190
May I?

6541
10:22:04,116 --> 10:22:06,869
I'm going to ask you a question, Letty,

6542
10:22:07,745 --> 10:22:11,625
and I want you to think very hard before you answer.

6543
10:22:12,041 --> 10:22:14,590
When I give you the order

6544
10:22:14,752 --> 10:22:16,174
to take Toretto out,

6545
10:22:18,756 --> 10:22:21,179
what will your first thought be?

6546
10:22:23,010 --> 10:22:25,513
Why don't you look me in the eye

6547
10:22:26,638 --> 10:22:30,438
and you tell me what you see.

6548
10:22:39,401 --> 10:22:40,698
Keep it.

6549
10:22:50,579 --> 10:22:52,581
Tej, talk to me, what have we got?

6550
10:22:52,748 --> 10:22:55,092
We were able to track Shaw after he left you and Dom,

6551
10:22:55,250 --> 10:22:57,878
but this guy's smart, so we could only track him so far.

6552
10:22:58,045 --> 10:23:00,423
He seems to know all the city's blind spots.

6553
10:23:00,589 --> 10:23:01,950
See, we lost him somewhere in here,

6554
10:23:02,049 --> 10:23:03,289
which means he could be anywhere

6555
10:23:03,300 --> 10:23:05,018
within that
half-a-mile radius.

6556
10:23:05,177 --> 10:23:08,101
Maybe if we cross-reference
phone records, leases...

6557
10:23:08,263 --> 10:23:10,311
No, this has got Shaw's name written all over it.

6558
10:23:10,474 --> 10:23:12,602
We've got vantage points, multiple exits,

6559
10:23:12,684 --> 10:23:14,231
subways, highways and storm drains.

6560
10:23:14,394 --> 10:23:15,896
Bad-ass and brains.

6561
10:23:16,063 --> 10:23:18,183
Woman, you keep that up, I'm going to be out of a job.

6562
10:23:18,440 --> 10:23:21,034
All right, let's go nail that son of a bitch.

6563
10:23:44,842 --> 10:23:45,889
They're long gone.

6564
10:23:46,426 --> 10:23:48,520
There's nothing here.

6565
10:23:56,687 --> 10:23:58,155
There's never nothing.

6566
10:24:06,155 --> 10:24:08,283
There's always something.

6567
10:24:14,580 --> 10:24:16,082
Let's go, guys.

6568
10:24:17,791 --> 10:24:21,967
Shaw, everyone is in place. All
things moving according to plan.

6569
10:24:25,174 --> 10:24:27,176
Good. Send him in.

6570
10:24:30,470 --> 10:24:32,438
Yo, it's Hobbs.

6571
10:24:33,849 --> 10:24:36,102
What have you got, Parker?
Give me something good.

6572
10:24:36,268 --> 10:24:39,863
Yeah, that paint you got from
Shaw's place is highly specialized.

6573
10:24:40,022 --> 10:24:42,195
Anti-thermal
low-IR coating.

6574
10:24:42,357 --> 10:24:44,325
Military.
Exactly.

6575
10:24:44,484 --> 10:24:47,158
We got a list of bases around
Europe that use this paint type

6576
10:24:47,321 --> 10:24:48,493
and those specific colors.

6577
10:24:48,655 --> 10:24:49,998
All right,
let's cross-reference that

6578
10:24:50,073 --> 10:24:51,871
with all of Shaw's military targets.

6579
10:24:52,034 --> 10:24:54,332
I guaran-damn-tee you
one of them is gonna match.

6580
10:24:55,704 --> 10:24:59,049
Bingo.
It's a NATO base in Spain.

6581
10:24:59,208 --> 10:25:00,688
That puts Shaw in a different country.

6582
10:25:01,126 --> 10:25:02,628
That means he's got
an eight-hour lead on us.

6583
10:25:02,794 --> 10:25:04,967
<i>We gotta move now.
Tej, give me that info.</i>

6584
10:25:05,297 --> 10:25:07,470
Riley and I will go ahead and we're
going to lock down the base.

6585
10:25:07,633 --> 10:25:09,727
We're going to protect that component personally.

6586
10:25:09,885 --> 10:25:12,604
Toretto, I'll arrange transportation
for you and your cars.

6587
10:25:12,763 --> 10:25:16,563
You brush up on your Spanish, boys.
I'll see you <i>en España.</i>

6588
10:25:39,081 --> 10:25:42,005
You son of a bitch!
You made it!

6589
10:25:42,542 --> 10:25:43,885
What up, man?
Good to see you.

6590
10:25:44,044 --> 10:25:46,422
Good to see you.
So, what's going on here?

6591
10:25:46,588 --> 10:25:48,386
Figured out they're hitting an army base in Spain.

6592
10:25:48,548 --> 10:25:51,222
Border patrol ID'ed Shaw's men
crossing through last night.

6593
10:25:51,385 --> 10:25:53,479
Hobbs and Riley went to lock down the base.

6594
10:25:53,637 --> 10:25:55,204
- They're going to meet us there.
- Where's Dom?

6595
10:25:55,222 --> 10:25:56,974
He wasn't going without you.

6596
10:26:03,313 --> 10:26:05,361
I found out what happened to Letty.

6597
10:26:06,066 --> 10:26:08,114
It's all my fault.

6598
10:26:09,111 --> 10:26:10,237
Brian,

6599
10:26:11,154 --> 10:26:14,499
whatever you found out, that's for you.

6600
10:26:15,075 --> 10:26:17,043
What we're about to do now

6601
10:26:18,495 --> 10:26:20,338
is for her.

6602
10:26:23,750 --> 10:26:25,798
We've got four teams on overwatch,

6603
10:26:25,961 --> 10:26:28,760
sniper-spotters in roosts
north and south of the target.

6604
10:26:28,922 --> 10:26:30,424
Just keep all your men out of sight.

6605
10:26:30,507 --> 10:26:31,674
When they drive that truck in here,

6606
10:26:31,675 --> 10:26:34,303
I want to come crashing down on
them like the walls of Jericho.

6607
10:26:34,469 --> 10:26:38,975
Hobbs, I just caught this one disabling
the perimeter security system.

6608
10:26:39,141 --> 10:26:41,360
Your house is compromised.
What are you suggesting?

6609
10:26:41,518 --> 10:26:42,565
I ain't suggesting.

6610
10:26:42,644 --> 10:26:44,863
We follow protocol, we move the component out.

6611
10:26:45,022 --> 10:26:47,982
Shaw thinks it's here. We're going to
get it out of here before he arrives.

6612
10:26:48,025 --> 10:26:49,902
Stealth and speed are going to be our two best friends.

6613
10:26:49,985 --> 10:26:52,186
We're going to protect our little
egg, move it out of the henhouse,

6614
10:26:52,321 --> 10:26:55,575
then we're going to wait for that goddamn fox to arrive.

6615
10:26:58,660 --> 10:27:01,459
I just got word they caught one of Shaw's men at the base.

6616
10:27:01,621 --> 10:27:02,747
It's time.

6617
10:27:02,914 --> 10:27:06,544
Something is not right.
He wanted us to find that guy.

6618
10:27:06,710 --> 10:27:09,589
Think about it. At Interpol, you
were face-to-face with him.

6619
10:27:10,339 --> 10:27:11,700
Brian, so what are you saying?

6620
10:27:12,090 --> 10:27:17,096
Braga said the only way you get
near Shaw is if he wants you to.

6621
10:27:17,763 --> 10:27:19,561
Tej, where's that component?

6622
10:27:19,973 --> 10:27:21,566
They're moving it to a secure location.

6623
10:27:26,605 --> 10:27:28,278
Shaw ain't hitting that base.

6624
10:27:28,440 --> 10:27:29,657
He's hitting the convoy.

6625
10:28:05,143 --> 10:28:06,190
Let's go!

6626
10:28:34,923 --> 10:28:37,017
We've got a report, the convoy's under attack.

6627
10:28:37,092 --> 10:28:38,139
Get a chopper, now!

6628
10:28:54,776 --> 10:28:57,199
Fellas, you better hurry up.
They just took the convoy.

6629
10:29:00,782 --> 10:29:02,125
And Dom,

6630
10:29:02,367 --> 10:29:03,869
<i>Letty's with them.</i>

6631
10:29:04,619 --> 10:29:06,963
We stick to the plan.

6632
10:29:13,628 --> 10:29:14,788
All right, you heard the man.

6633
10:29:14,796 --> 10:29:16,036
Let's play this fast and clean.

6634
10:29:16,047 --> 10:29:17,247
That thing's heading your way.

6635
10:29:55,253 --> 10:29:56,425
<i>All systems go.</i>

6636
10:29:56,588 --> 10:29:58,590
Everything looks stable.

6637
10:29:59,257 --> 10:30:01,430
Uh, guys, we gotta come up with another plan.

6638
10:30:04,763 --> 10:30:05,764
They got a tank.

6639
10:30:05,931 --> 10:30:08,354
I'm sorry, did somebody just say "a tank?"

6640
10:30:14,606 --> 10:30:15,858
We got company, guys.

6641
10:30:16,024 --> 10:30:18,277
<i>Toretto is coming right at you.</i>

6642
10:30:18,443 --> 10:30:21,071
Okay. Get the weapons hot.

6643
10:30:22,614 --> 10:30:24,616
Give me satellite imaging.

6644
10:31:18,628 --> 10:31:20,426
Straight ahead of us.

6645
10:31:21,172 --> 10:31:22,640
There you are.

6646
10:31:37,480 --> 10:31:38,823
Who's got a plan B?

6647
10:31:38,982 --> 10:31:41,531
Plan B?
We need a plan C, D, E.

6648
10:31:41,693 --> 10:31:42,865
<i>We need more alphabets!</i>

6649
10:31:43,028 --> 10:31:46,157
Hey, we do what we do best.

6650
10:31:46,323 --> 10:31:47,791
We improvise, all right?

6651
10:32:04,049 --> 10:32:07,053
Okay, Jah.
Take it to the other side.

6652
10:32:07,218 --> 10:32:08,561
Let's have some fun.

6653
10:32:24,402 --> 10:32:26,996
What the hell is wrong with you?
This isn't part of the plan.

6654
10:32:39,709 --> 10:32:41,757
Take their attention away from the people!

6655
10:32:54,933 --> 10:32:56,731
Shaw, you don't have to do this.

6656
10:33:07,779 --> 10:33:09,452
We got one right in front of us.

6657
10:33:09,781 --> 10:33:10,873
Boom.

6658
10:33:12,742 --> 10:33:13,789
Oh, shit!

6659
10:33:21,084 --> 10:33:22,461
You lucky bastard.

6660
10:33:23,586 --> 10:33:25,213
Roman, you hang in there.

6661
10:33:25,380 --> 10:33:26,973
<i>Hang in there, mam!</i>

6662
10:33:30,385 --> 10:33:34,060
Somebody better do something!
I got a tank on my ass!

6663
10:33:36,391 --> 10:33:37,984
There's gotta be a break up ahead.

6664
10:33:42,480 --> 10:33:43,606
Oh, look,

6665
10:33:44,607 --> 10:33:45,654
a bridge.

6666
10:34:15,805 --> 10:34:16,852
Screw it.

6667
10:34:48,004 --> 10:34:49,631
Yeah!

6668
10:34:53,051 --> 10:34:54,894
We're dragging a car behind us.

6669
10:34:56,346 --> 10:34:59,020
Brian, that Mustang would make a nice anchor.

6670
10:34:59,182 --> 10:35:00,354
Yeah, I'm on it.

6671
10:35:25,583 --> 10:35:26,584
Damn!

6672
10:35:26,751 --> 10:35:28,503
Shaw, we've got to get rid of that car.

6673
10:35:28,670 --> 10:35:31,219
Letty, go take care of the cable.

6674
10:35:46,771 --> 10:35:47,863
Yeah!

6675
10:35:50,608 --> 10:35:51,951
What's she doing?

6676
10:35:52,110 --> 10:35:53,282
Shit!

6677
10:35:54,153 --> 10:35:55,621
Okay, Toretto.

6678
10:35:58,408 --> 10:35:59,455
Here's your girl...

6679
10:36:02,579 --> 10:36:04,172
And your happy ending.

6680
10:36:04,330 --> 10:36:05,502
Letty!

6681
10:36:40,825 --> 10:36:43,328
Jesus Christ.

6682
10:36:50,793 --> 10:36:52,887
I can't believe they
stole a 70-ton tank

6683
10:36:53,004 --> 10:36:54,301
for a three-ounce
computer chip.

6684
10:36:54,464 --> 10:36:58,344
That 3-ounce computer chip is more
deadly than 1,000 of those tanks.

6685
10:37:01,888 --> 10:37:03,515
What about her?

6686
10:37:04,015 --> 10:37:05,688
Not her.

6687
10:37:05,850 --> 10:37:07,318
She was working with Shaw.

6688
10:37:07,477 --> 10:37:08,569
Was,

6689
10:37:10,688 --> 10:37:12,690
but she's always been one of us.

6690
10:37:15,818 --> 10:37:17,741
Let's give them a minute.

6691
10:37:31,584 --> 10:37:33,552
Let's go process Shaw and his crew.

6692
10:37:33,711 --> 10:37:36,885
I've never looked more forward to
filling out paperwork in my life.

6693
10:37:53,606 --> 10:37:54,903
Hey.

6694
10:37:58,236 --> 10:38:01,581
Look, I don't even know how to say this to you,

6695
10:38:06,285 --> 10:38:08,583
but everything that's happened here is because of me.

6696
10:38:09,247 --> 10:38:10,727
I'm the one that put you undercover...

6697
10:38:10,748 --> 10:38:12,421
Stop.

6698
10:38:13,418 --> 10:38:15,091
I may not remember anything,

6699
10:38:16,421 --> 10:38:19,140
but I know one thing about myself.

6700
10:38:19,424 --> 10:38:22,644
Nobody makes me do anything I don't want to.

6701
10:38:35,106 --> 10:38:38,235
So, what's our next adventure after this?

6702
10:38:40,153 --> 10:38:43,828
How about we stay in one place?

6703
10:38:44,782 --> 10:38:45,954
Where are you thinking?

6704
10:38:46,117 --> 10:38:47,619
Tokyo.

6705
10:38:48,244 --> 10:38:50,622
We always talk about Tokyo.

6706
10:38:51,956 --> 10:38:54,334
Tokyo it is.

6707
10:39:00,757 --> 10:39:03,476
Can I ask you something?

6708
10:39:11,517 --> 10:39:15,772
How did you know that there would
be a car there to break our fall?

6709
10:39:16,481 --> 10:39:17,983
I didn't.

6710
10:39:21,944 --> 10:39:25,539
Some things you just have to take on faith.

6711
10:39:27,200 --> 10:39:28,622
Hey, Toretto!

6712
10:39:28,785 --> 10:39:30,503
You need to hear this.

6713
10:39:44,342 --> 10:39:47,346
You guys really think you've won.

6714
10:39:48,346 --> 10:39:49,973
This code you live by,

6715
10:39:50,848 --> 10:39:54,022
it's the very reason why you weren't even in the game.

6716
10:39:56,687 --> 10:40:00,032
I told you exactly what I was gonna
do if you didn't walk away, Toretto.

6717
10:40:01,067 --> 10:40:02,159
Go!

6718
10:40:02,985 --> 10:40:04,532
But you didn't listen.

6719
10:40:05,363 --> 10:40:09,584
<i>I told you I can reach out and break you whenever I want.</i>

6720
10:40:12,161 --> 10:40:13,788
And I have.

6721
10:40:13,871 --> 10:40:14,997
Come on.

6722
10:40:18,042 --> 10:40:19,259
Go.
No!

6723
10:40:19,418 --> 10:40:21,591
Maybe you should call Mia.

6724
10:40:35,268 --> 10:40:36,770
Mia?
Brian!

6725
10:40:40,231 --> 10:40:41,574
Let me go!

6726
10:40:54,871 --> 10:40:57,590
So, this is how it's gonna go down.

6727
10:40:58,124 --> 10:41:00,092
You're gonna cut me loose from these cuffs,

6728
10:41:00,543 --> 10:41:01,795
you're gonna hand me the chip,

6729
10:41:01,961 --> 10:41:04,122
I'm gonna walk out of here and you're not gonna follow.

6730
10:41:04,130 --> 10:41:06,303
You must be joking.

6731
10:41:10,303 --> 10:41:11,555
Look at his face.

6732
10:41:15,558 --> 10:41:16,935
Ask him if I'm joking.

6733
10:41:17,101 --> 10:41:21,823
One hostage does not outweigh the threat to millions.

6734
10:41:22,899 --> 10:41:26,654
I'm sorry, but this changes nothing.

6735
10:41:31,741 --> 10:41:33,084
It changes everything.

6736
10:41:34,452 --> 10:41:37,171
You tell your men to stand down.

6737
10:41:39,957 --> 10:41:41,800
Stand down.

6738
10:41:44,086 --> 10:41:45,133
Toretto,

6739
10:41:46,130 --> 10:41:47,347
I need you to know,

6740
10:41:47,632 --> 10:41:51,102
the moment we let him walk out that door with that chip,

6741
10:41:51,260 --> 10:41:54,309
words like "amnesty" and "pardon"

6742
10:41:54,472 --> 10:41:56,145
walk out with him.

6743
10:42:01,812 --> 10:42:05,658
Those words went out the day we were born.

6744
10:42:35,012 --> 10:42:36,685
Coming, babe?

6745
10:42:42,186 --> 10:42:43,529
Of course.

6746
10:42:45,356 --> 10:42:47,029
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

6747
10:42:50,861 --> 10:42:52,534
Like I said,

6748
10:42:54,031 --> 10:42:56,375
you were never in the game.

6749
10:42:57,118 --> 10:43:01,214
If I see you on the horizon, I'll
make the call and the girl's dead.

6750
10:43:14,385 --> 10:43:16,479
So, what about Toretto's sister?

6751
10:43:18,306 --> 10:43:20,058
There's no need for her anymore.

6752
10:43:25,563 --> 10:43:28,487
I just jammed every signal up and down the spectrum.

6753
10:43:30,735 --> 10:43:32,408
Let's move.

6754
10:43:32,570 --> 10:43:34,914
I'm coming with you.

6755
10:44:08,022 --> 10:44:09,945
Where the hell does this dude think he's going?

6756
10:44:10,107 --> 10:44:11,950
We're on an army base, he's trapped.

6757
10:44:20,451 --> 10:44:22,704
Wow, you just had to open your mouth.

6758
10:44:22,995 --> 10:44:24,997
Now we got a big-ass
plane to deal with.

6759
10:44:25,164 --> 10:44:27,337
That ain't a plane.
That's a planet.

6760
10:44:44,308 --> 10:44:48,154
She's as good as dead if Shaw gets away on that plane.

6761
10:44:51,899 --> 10:44:53,822
Then we don't let him get away.

6762
10:45:01,492 --> 10:45:03,665
Let's end this thing.

6763
10:45:12,211 --> 10:45:13,463
Ride or die.

6764
10:45:14,547 --> 10:45:15,639
Ride or die.

6765
10:46:41,258 --> 10:46:42,635
Tell them to take off!

6766
10:46:53,479 --> 10:46:54,776
Babe, get me under the wing.

6767
10:46:54,939 --> 10:46:57,442
If I can hit that flap, we can keep it from taking off.

6768
10:47:02,446 --> 10:47:03,618
You be careful.

6769
10:47:04,615 --> 10:47:06,458
This is who we are.

6770
10:47:18,629 --> 10:47:19,630
Shit!

6771
10:47:23,300 --> 10:47:24,301
Grab the wheel!

6772
10:48:14,143 --> 10:48:15,190
Dom!

6773
10:48:22,401 --> 10:48:23,493
Go!

6774
10:48:23,694 --> 10:48:24,991
Come on. Let's go.

6775
10:48:41,211 --> 10:48:42,337
Get in the car.

6776
10:50:16,056 --> 10:50:17,057
Whoo!

6777
10:51:52,861 --> 10:51:54,408
What happened?
Did you hit the flap?

6778
10:51:55,030 --> 10:51:56,031
Uh...

6779
10:51:56,698 --> 10:51:58,075
You should buckle up right now.

6780
10:51:58,200 --> 10:51:59,247
What?

6781
10:52:15,092 --> 10:52:16,184
Hey!

6782
10:52:20,264 --> 10:52:21,390
Wrong team, bitch.

6783
10:53:06,143 --> 10:53:07,144
Shit.

6784
10:53:28,206 --> 10:53:29,207
Yeah!

6785
10:53:45,557 --> 10:53:46,900
I got you.

6786
10:54:55,210 --> 10:54:56,302
Tej!

6787
10:54:56,712 --> 10:54:57,804
Keep her steady!

6788
10:54:58,463 --> 10:55:00,386
We gotta move, it's going down!
Go!

6789
10:55:05,095 --> 10:55:06,813
Go, now!

6790
10:55:10,100 --> 10:55:12,068
Come on, let's move, move, move!

6791
10:55:18,316 --> 10:55:19,317
Come on!

6792
10:55:23,405 --> 10:55:24,748
Dom!

6793
10:58:29,841 --> 10:58:31,468
Where's Gisele?

6794
10:58:35,472 --> 10:58:37,315
Where's Gisele?

6795
10:59:06,378 --> 10:59:09,473
So this is worth billions, huh?

6796
10:59:14,010 --> 10:59:15,387
Yes, it is.

6797
10:59:20,183 --> 10:59:21,480
Name your price, Dom.

6798
10:59:26,398 --> 10:59:28,867
1327.

6799
10:59:54,843 --> 10:59:56,595
Don't burn it this time.
Please?

6800
10:59:56,761 --> 10:59:59,105
I never go and burn it, man.

6801
11:00:01,266 --> 11:00:02,859
Good food.

6802
11:00:03,351 --> 11:00:07,527
The air quality here is lousy, the traffic is bad,

6803
11:00:08,273 --> 11:00:09,993
but I think you'll learn to like this place.

6804
11:00:10,108 --> 11:00:12,611
Yeah, and here you've got your own garage

6805
11:00:12,736 --> 11:00:14,704
so you can build a car with Daddy.

6806
11:00:14,779 --> 11:00:15,871
We'll be building a car?

6807
11:00:15,947 --> 11:00:18,450
First car better be a Charger, Jack.

6808
11:00:19,451 --> 11:00:20,703
You mean Skyline.

6809
11:00:21,953 --> 11:00:24,126
Like I said, he's a Toretto.

6810
11:00:24,456 --> 11:00:25,799
You're confusing the kid.

6811
11:00:25,957 --> 11:00:27,129
Mia, you're gonna let him get away with this?

6812
11:00:27,292 --> 11:00:28,714
You're really going to do it?

6813
11:00:29,544 --> 11:00:30,591
Tokyo.

6814
11:00:31,796 --> 11:00:34,470
Yeah, it's just something I gotta do.

6815
11:00:34,632 --> 11:00:37,977
You know we got your back, whenever you need us.

6816
11:00:42,057 --> 11:00:44,480
Hey, Mia, you better hide your baby oil.

6817
11:00:44,559 --> 11:00:45,560
I'm just playing.

6818
11:00:45,643 --> 11:00:47,316
You better hide that big-ass forehead.

6819
11:00:47,479 --> 11:00:48,731
I was just joking, but whatever.

6820
11:00:49,230 --> 11:00:50,652
Definitely not that funny.

6821
11:00:50,815 --> 11:00:52,488
It's official.

6822
11:00:52,650 --> 11:00:53,822
You're all free.

6823
11:00:53,902 --> 11:00:55,279
Mmm.
Mmm.

6824
11:00:57,822 --> 11:01:00,325
It wasn't half bad, having you work for me.

6825
11:01:02,660 --> 11:01:05,004
We all know you were working for me, Hobbs.

6826
11:01:05,663 --> 11:01:07,961
Agree to disagree.

6827
11:01:08,124 --> 11:01:09,171
Thank you.

6828
11:01:10,126 --> 11:01:11,343
Good luck.

6829
11:01:13,004 --> 11:01:14,005
Elena?

6830
11:01:14,172 --> 11:01:15,264
Letty.

6831
11:01:15,340 --> 11:01:17,342
This is gonna be awkward.

6832
11:01:17,842 --> 11:01:20,015
But sexy as hell.
Sexy as hell.

6833
11:01:20,678 --> 11:01:23,682
I wanted to thank you for everything you've done for him.

6834
11:01:24,140 --> 11:01:25,483
For us.

6835
11:01:26,017 --> 11:01:28,019
It takes an amazing woman.

6836
11:01:29,979 --> 11:01:31,526
He's an amazing guy.

6837
11:01:32,190 --> 11:01:33,692
Yeah, he is.

6838
11:01:35,193 --> 11:01:37,491
Try to keep him out of trouble, huh?

6839
11:01:38,863 --> 11:01:41,457
Now, you know that's not gonna happen.

6840
11:01:42,367 --> 11:01:43,539
I know.

6841
11:01:46,496 --> 11:01:48,840
Not bad for a cop.

6842
11:01:56,423 --> 11:01:59,267
I never thought I'd trust a criminal.

6843
11:02:01,928 --> 11:02:03,680
Until next time.

6844
11:02:04,264 --> 11:02:07,017
Until next time.

6845
11:02:13,440 --> 11:02:14,487
Elena.

6846
11:02:23,366 --> 11:02:24,788
You know you don't have to go.

6847
11:02:27,787 --> 11:02:31,257
All this...
This is your family.

6848
11:02:32,292 --> 11:02:34,135
It's who you are.

6849
11:02:34,544 --> 11:02:36,467
This is my family.

6850
11:02:38,798 --> 11:02:40,641
This is who I am.

6851
11:02:58,818 --> 11:03:00,258
All right, everybody, let's eat.

6852
11:03:00,487 --> 11:03:01,727
Want some help with that?

6853
11:03:01,738 --> 11:03:03,285
It's all here, it's done.

6854
11:03:04,157 --> 11:03:06,501
Come on, man, let's get with it.

6855
11:03:09,329 --> 11:03:11,002
First bite, he's got grace.

6856
11:03:11,164 --> 11:03:12,837
House rules, man.
House rules.

6857
11:03:15,251 --> 11:03:17,845
Any of this feel familiar to you?

6858
11:03:21,966 --> 11:03:23,513
No.

6859
11:03:26,137 --> 11:03:28,265
But it feels like home.

6860
11:03:29,098 --> 11:03:30,441
That's good enough for me.

6861
11:03:31,226 --> 11:03:33,729
All right, y'all.
Come on, let's do this.

6862
11:03:34,604 --> 11:03:36,322
Okay, Roman,

6863
11:03:38,024 --> 11:03:39,822
bless our table.

6864
11:03:45,448 --> 11:03:48,702
Father, thank you for the gathering of friends.

6865
11:03:48,868 --> 11:03:51,667
Father, we give thanks for all the choices we've made,

6866
11:03:51,829 --> 11:03:54,423
because that's what makes us who we are.

6867
11:03:54,582 --> 11:03:58,303
Let us forever cherish the loved
ones we've lost along the way.

6868
11:03:58,461 --> 11:04:00,008
Thank you for the little angel,

6869
11:04:00,088 --> 11:04:02,056
the newest addition to our family.

6870
11:04:02,215 --> 11:04:04,058
Thank you for bringing Letty home.

6871
11:04:04,217 --> 11:04:07,892
And most of all, thank you for fast cars.

6872
11:06:45,922 --> 11:06:47,219
Nice ride.

6873
11:06:48,424 --> 11:06:49,857
It does the job.

6874
11:06:50,193 --> 11:06:52,753
What job, delivering pizzas?

6875
11:06:54,430 --> 11:06:57,160
Well, it's not the ride,
it's the rider.

6876
11:07:01,571 --> 11:07:02,970
What the hell was that?

6877
11:07:03,039 --> 11:07:04,097
What?

6878
11:07:04,307 --> 11:07:06,707
Hey! You talking to my girl?

6879
11:07:06,843 --> 11:07:09,038
Oh, shit. Here we go. Yeah.

6880
11:07:09,112 --> 11:07:12,138
She was just admiring my ride.

6881
11:07:12,348 --> 11:07:13,440
"My ride."

6882
11:07:13,516 --> 11:07:15,108
My grandma's Buick could smoke

6883
11:07:15,184 --> 11:07:17,118
that piece of shit, trailer trash.

6884
11:07:17,720 --> 11:07:19,915
Well, what about your daddy's Viper?

6885
11:07:20,890 --> 11:07:22,790
This beast's got 500 horsepower...

6886
11:07:22,859 --> 11:07:23,985
and a Borla exhaust system.

6887
11:07:24,060 --> 11:07:25,925
It does 0 to 60
in like 4.3 seconds...

6888
11:07:25,995 --> 11:07:27,963
That's about right.
That's about right. Yeah.

6889
11:07:28,030 --> 11:07:30,362
Wow. You can read the brochure.

6890
11:07:53,823 --> 11:07:56,656
What a pitch, baby.
What a pitch. I like that.

6891
11:07:56,826 --> 11:07:58,817
What's he gonna do?

6892
11:07:58,895 --> 11:08:00,829
- Let's make it happen.
- Bring it.

6893
11:08:11,507 --> 11:08:13,771
I got your...
I got your back.

6894
11:08:15,678 --> 11:08:18,340
Why don't you nice boys
let your cars do the talking?

6895
11:08:20,249 --> 11:08:22,342
I only race for pink slips.

6896
11:08:23,352 --> 11:08:25,149
This car goes for 80 grand.

6897
11:08:25,221 --> 11:08:28,315
What would I do with a broken-ass
piece of shit like that?

6898
11:08:32,795 --> 11:08:34,285
How about me?

6899
11:08:37,733 --> 11:08:41,396
Winner gets me.

6900
11:08:48,477 --> 11:08:51,241
Cut it, let's cut it.
Let's go, go, go, go!

6901
11:09:06,028 --> 11:09:07,859
Blast-off, baby!

6902
11:09:10,600 --> 11:09:12,625
First one out the other side...

6903
11:09:13,336 --> 11:09:15,827
It's time. Let's go!

6904
11:09:15,905 --> 11:09:18,305
Ready, boys?
Make it interesting, Clay.

6905
11:10:02,385 --> 11:10:03,477
Shit!

6906
11:10:15,031 --> 11:10:16,157
Yeah!

6907
11:11:26,135 --> 11:11:27,762
I thought you loved me.

6908
11:11:36,045 --> 11:11:37,273
Oh, well.

6909
11:11:48,023 --> 11:11:49,513
What the hell?

6910
11:11:59,402 --> 11:12:01,700
Guess I got a new date for prom.

6911
11:12:11,580 --> 11:12:13,775
Clay, stop the car! Shut up!

6912
11:12:22,758 --> 11:12:23,747
Clay, stop the car!

6913
11:12:23,826 --> 11:12:24,850
Shut up!

6914
11:12:24,927 --> 11:12:26,155
Stop it!

6915
11:12:30,599 --> 11:12:32,794
Clay, please stop! Please stop!

6916
11:13:43,939 --> 11:13:45,964
Can I get a copy of that?

6917
11:13:48,043 --> 11:13:50,273
You think this is a joke, huh?

6918
11:13:51,814 --> 11:13:53,543
You see Ken and Barbie over there?

6919
11:13:53,616 --> 11:13:56,483
They're gonna walk out of here
without even a slap on the wrist.

6920
11:13:56,552 --> 11:13:58,986
Mommy and Daddy are too hooked up.

6921
11:14:01,790 --> 11:14:04,020
But I like screw-ups like you.

6922
11:14:04,093 --> 11:14:05,526
You know why?

6923
11:14:05,594 --> 11:14:08,392
'Cause you're 100%
guaranteed conviction.

6924
11:14:08,697 --> 11:14:10,494
- Where's my car?
- I crushed it.

6925
11:14:10,566 --> 11:14:11,692
You did what?

6926
11:14:11,767 --> 11:14:12,927
- Sit down! You're done.
- Easy, easy.

6927
11:14:13,002 --> 11:14:14,401
You're done.
You understand me? You're done.

6928
11:14:14,470 --> 11:14:17,303
And all before your eighteenth
birthday. Now sit down.

6929
11:14:19,542 --> 11:14:20,668
Sean.

6930
11:14:22,011 --> 11:14:24,275
What the hell were
you thinkin', huh?

6931
11:14:25,114 --> 11:14:27,207
Mrs. Boswell? Please.

6932
11:14:28,684 --> 11:14:30,549
It's, uh, it's Miss.

6933
11:14:33,322 --> 11:14:37,554
Officer, is it, um,
illegal to smoke in here?

6934
11:14:45,601 --> 11:14:47,193
It's a tough state.

6935
11:14:47,336 --> 11:14:49,429
And it's a pretty clear-cut case.

6936
11:14:50,139 --> 11:14:53,302
He'll be lucky if they don't
try him as an adult.

6937
11:14:55,210 --> 11:14:58,179
This is our third town
in two years.

6938
11:14:59,315 --> 11:15:01,374
Your son's got two priors
for reckless driving,

6939
11:15:01,450 --> 11:15:03,441
willful destruction of property.

6940
11:15:03,519 --> 11:15:05,487
This makes it strike three.

6941
11:15:05,554 --> 11:15:08,182
They're definitely gonna want
to get him off the streets.

6942
11:15:08,257 --> 11:15:11,090
Well, there's
just got to be another way.

6943
11:15:19,902 --> 11:15:22,336
So, where are we moving this time?

6944
11:15:24,907 --> 11:15:27,000
We are not moving anywhere.

6945
11:16:25,000 --> 11:16:26,969
<i>I worked with Gisele.</i>

6946
11:16:27,003 --> 11:16:28,938
Back when I was a CIA operative

6947
11:16:28,971 --> 11:16:32,275
running the drug trade
in Central America.

6948
11:16:33,709 --> 11:16:34,978
The good old days.

6949
11:16:35,011 --> 11:16:37,614
Gisele was my best.

6950
11:16:37,646 --> 11:16:39,715
You can lose an asset
at any time.

6951
11:16:41,683 --> 11:16:45,254
Bullet, knife, wire.

6952
11:16:45,288 --> 11:16:48,290
But I never thought
I'd lose her...

6953
11:16:48,324 --> 11:16:49,692
To love.

6954
11:16:52,861 --> 11:16:54,263
What do you want?

6955
11:16:54,297 --> 11:16:57,500
I'm offering you a job, Han.

6956
11:16:57,532 --> 11:16:59,602
Here, in Tokyo.

6957
11:16:59,634 --> 11:17:01,036
Why me?

6958
11:17:01,070 --> 11:17:03,406
'Cause I saw your work
with Gisele.

6959
11:17:03,438 --> 11:17:05,842
I saw that she trusted you.

6960
11:17:07,410 --> 11:17:10,313
And that means I can trust you.

6961
11:17:10,346 --> 11:17:15,285
And that is very rare
in this line of work.

6962
11:18:16,000 --> 11:18:17,092
Sean.

6963
11:18:18,035 --> 11:18:20,026
I thought you were
gonna be here on the 7th.

6964
11:18:20,104 --> 11:18:21,731
Today is the 7th.

6965
11:18:23,140 --> 11:18:25,665
Well, look,
just hold on one second.

6966
11:18:51,969 --> 11:18:53,368
Come on in.

6967
11:18:58,409 --> 11:18:59,774
This is it.

6968
11:19:06,918 --> 11:19:09,512
You know, Sean, I was,
I was gonna be there.

6969
11:19:10,121 --> 11:19:12,646
But your mom,
she said the 7th, see,

6970
11:19:12,723 --> 11:19:15,351
and we're a day
ahead of you in Japan.

6971
11:19:17,395 --> 11:19:20,558
Well, you're here now,
and that's good.

6972
11:19:22,099 --> 11:19:24,260
So, how is your mom?

6973
11:19:26,304 --> 11:19:27,931
Where do I sleep?

6974
11:19:28,739 --> 11:19:30,969
Now, Sean, you know
she had no other choice.

6975
11:19:31,042 --> 11:19:33,772
I mean, it was
either this or juvie hall,

6976
11:19:34,779 --> 11:19:36,610
I mean, you just
can't keep moving away...

6977
11:19:36,681 --> 11:19:38,649
every time you get into trouble.

6978
11:19:39,116 --> 11:19:40,640
Worked for you.

6979
11:19:44,121 --> 11:19:46,453
Look, neither of us asked for this.

6980
11:19:47,058 --> 11:19:49,993
But I promised your mom
I'd take care of you.

6981
11:19:50,394 --> 11:19:53,454
So you just go by the
rules her and I agreed to,

6982
11:19:53,531 --> 11:19:55,465
and I'm sure
you'll manage just fine.

6983
11:19:55,900 --> 11:19:57,094
Rules?

6984
11:19:57,168 --> 11:19:59,762
Yeah, rules. Real simple.

6985
11:20:00,338 --> 11:20:01,771
You go to school,

6986
11:20:01,839 --> 11:20:03,500
you come back here right after.

6987
11:20:03,808 --> 11:20:05,435
And I don't want to see or hear

6988
11:20:05,509 --> 11:20:07,374
about you anywhere near a car.

6989
11:20:08,713 --> 11:20:11,910
Here, the bedroom is yours.

6990
11:20:17,722 --> 11:20:19,747
Make yourself comfortable.

6991
11:20:22,226 --> 11:20:23,853
Lights out in 10.

6992
11:21:15,200 --> 11:21:16,936
Get down!

6993
11:22:00,700 --> 11:22:02,292
You got to be kiddin'.

6994
11:22:59,659 --> 11:23:01,092
Wrong train.

6995
11:23:01,594 --> 11:23:03,061
I'm new here.

6996
11:23:08,101 --> 11:23:09,864
Boswell, yes, ma'am.

6997
11:24:10,630 --> 11:24:12,928
Japanese food is like the Army.

6998
11:24:13,566 --> 11:24:15,431
Don't ask, don't tell.

6999
11:24:16,636 --> 11:24:18,001
Name's Twinkie.

7000
11:24:18,104 --> 11:24:20,095
Hey, I noticed
you ain't have a laptop.

7001
11:24:22,008 --> 11:24:23,134
Yeah?

7002
11:24:23,643 --> 11:24:25,873
I'll hook you up. Half price.

7003
11:24:27,080 --> 11:24:28,411
No, I'm cool.

7004
11:24:28,481 --> 11:24:29,971
60% off. Hmm?

7005
11:24:30,049 --> 11:24:32,108
Since we're both army
brats and everything.

7006
11:24:32,719 --> 11:24:34,710
I ain't got no cash, man.

7007
11:24:34,787 --> 11:24:36,618
And I ain't an army brat.

7008
11:24:36,689 --> 11:24:38,054
All right, all right.

7009
11:24:38,124 --> 11:24:39,716
Well, what about
a cell phone, huh?

7010
11:24:40,693 --> 11:24:42,888
Everybody needs a cell phone.

7011
11:24:43,162 --> 11:24:44,527
No offense,

7012
11:24:44,864 --> 11:24:46,126
but I'm probably
not gonna be here...

7013
11:24:46,199 --> 11:24:48,030
long enough to remember your name.

7014
11:24:48,701 --> 11:24:52,137
Then you gonna need some new
shoes to book town with, man.

7015
11:24:52,205 --> 11:24:53,672
You like Michael Jordan?

7016
11:24:53,806 --> 11:24:55,273
I love Michael Jordan.

7017
11:24:56,542 --> 11:24:58,066
Check this out.

7018
11:24:58,377 --> 11:25:00,902
Brand new Jordans.
Not even out yet.

7019
11:25:00,980 --> 11:25:04,211
LeBron James couldn't even
get his hands on those.

7020
11:25:05,885 --> 11:25:08,410
You selling that
Sparco steering wheel?

7021
11:25:08,488 --> 11:25:10,922
Hell, no.
That's mine right there.

7022
11:25:11,224 --> 11:25:13,522
Man, I even paid
retail for it.

7023
11:25:14,293 --> 11:25:15,419
What you drive?

7024
11:25:15,495 --> 11:25:17,156
- My ride?
- Yeah.

7025
11:25:17,230 --> 11:25:18,857
My ride's one of a kind.

7026
11:25:18,931 --> 11:25:20,091
Show me.

7027
11:25:20,733 --> 11:25:23,258
Thought you
weren't stickin' around.

7028
11:25:24,103 --> 11:25:25,297
All right.

7029
11:26:17,089 --> 11:26:20,354
Slamming, huh? Look at that car.

7030
11:26:22,261 --> 11:26:24,126
At least let me drive.

7031
11:26:24,297 --> 11:26:26,663
Y'all better have some
real cars around here.

7032
11:26:26,732 --> 11:26:28,791
Okay, I see
somebody got jokes, huh?

7033
11:26:28,868 --> 11:26:30,426
Well, all right.

7034
11:26:30,503 --> 11:26:32,437
I don't know if you're
ready for them, though.

7035
11:26:32,505 --> 11:26:34,530
You look a little nervous.

7036
11:26:35,074 --> 11:26:36,598
What up, Tosh?

7037
11:27:11,143 --> 11:27:13,475
For when you
blow your wad, man.

7038
11:28:11,070 --> 11:28:12,196
Hear that?

7039
11:28:12,271 --> 11:28:14,102
It's still not right
for the way I drive.

7040
11:28:16,442 --> 11:28:19,377
I don't need a computer to tell
me about my throttle response.

7041
11:28:19,445 --> 11:28:21,845
Okay. Then we're done here.

7042
11:28:24,517 --> 11:28:27,315
You wouldn't have
that problem with a V8.

7043
11:28:28,120 --> 11:28:29,417
Boys.

7044
11:28:29,488 --> 11:28:32,821
All they care about is
who's got the biggest engine.

7045
11:28:33,359 --> 11:28:35,589
I'm a guy. It's in my DNA.

7046
11:28:36,996 --> 11:28:38,759
So y'all race with these things,
huh?

7047
11:28:39,432 --> 11:28:41,195
Cute little toys.

7048
11:28:42,335 --> 11:28:45,566
You know, I almost didn't recognize
you without your slippers on.

7049
11:28:45,638 --> 11:28:47,538
Don't you mean uwabaki?

7050
11:28:48,741 --> 11:28:50,208
Neela, right?

7051
11:28:50,977 --> 11:28:52,877
You're a quick learner.

7052
11:28:55,648 --> 11:28:57,377
So, where you from, anyway?

7053
11:28:57,450 --> 11:28:58,576
Here.

7054
11:28:59,051 --> 11:29:00,712
No, I mean, not where you live.

7055
11:29:00,786 --> 11:29:02,413
Where'd you come from?

7056
11:29:02,488 --> 11:29:04,581
Does it really matter
where I'm from?

7057
11:29:12,398 --> 11:29:14,059
Who's the tourist?

7058
11:29:16,669 --> 11:29:19,001
What's with you
and the schoolgirls, D?

7059
11:29:19,071 --> 11:29:20,561
You're moving up in the world.

7060
11:29:20,639 --> 11:29:22,300
You gotta elevate your company.

7061
11:29:22,375 --> 11:29:24,036
Wednesday, Wednesday,
meet Thursday.

7062
11:29:24,110 --> 11:29:25,577
God. Girl.

7063
11:29:29,849 --> 11:29:31,578
Ladies, hold that thought, all right?

7064
11:29:31,650 --> 11:29:33,242
All right, beautiful. Hold up.

7065
11:29:33,319 --> 11:29:34,308
Hey!

7066
11:29:35,554 --> 11:29:36,987
He was just leaving.

7067
11:29:41,560 --> 11:29:43,994
I'm sorry.
I don't speak Japanese.

7068
11:29:47,533 --> 11:29:50,502
Understand that? Gaijin?

7069
11:29:50,569 --> 11:29:51,797
Takashi.

7070
11:29:52,338 --> 11:29:53,896
We were just talking.

7071
11:29:53,973 --> 11:29:55,838
This isn't your scene.

7072
11:29:56,709 --> 11:30:00,805
That word you called me,
gaijin or something or other,

7073
11:30:01,414 --> 11:30:03,541
what does that mean exactly?

7074
11:30:04,417 --> 11:30:06,977
Means, turn around,

7075
11:30:08,087 --> 11:30:09,281
keep walking.

7076
11:30:09,355 --> 11:30:10,686
That's exactly what we gonna do.

7077
11:30:10,756 --> 11:30:11,848
Come on, man, let's roll.

7078
11:30:11,924 --> 11:30:13,391
Yo, look, man, he's Yakuza.

7079
11:30:13,459 --> 11:30:16,428
Now, see, that's funny,

7080
11:30:16,495 --> 11:30:19,555
'cause I thought this
was, like, a free country

7081
11:30:20,399 --> 11:30:23,334
where a girl could talk
to whoever she wants.

7082
11:30:26,439 --> 11:30:28,339
You know who I am, boy?

7083
11:30:28,674 --> 11:30:32,872
Yeah. You're like the Justin
Timberlake of Japan, right?

7084
11:30:38,717 --> 11:30:39,877
Leave.

7085
11:30:40,086 --> 11:30:43,180
Damn, man.
You know Yakuza? The Mafia?

7086
11:30:45,424 --> 11:30:46,948
Look, sorry, DK-san.

7087
11:30:47,026 --> 11:30:48,994
Monkey didn't have
his banana today.

7088
11:30:49,128 --> 11:30:50,857
Hey, D, let's go.

7089
11:30:50,930 --> 11:30:52,295
It's time to race.

7090
11:30:56,435 --> 11:30:58,300
Hey, good luck, Timberlake.

7091
11:31:06,879 --> 11:31:10,838
You're the one that's lucky,
'cause I'm about to race.

7092
11:31:13,819 --> 11:31:15,411
Then let's race.

7093
11:31:18,190 --> 11:31:21,250
With what, huh? Your skateboard?

7094
11:31:23,496 --> 11:31:26,294
Easy to sound cocky
when you got no ride.

7095
11:31:26,966 --> 11:31:28,297
Take mine.

7096
11:31:32,404 --> 11:31:33,769
Let's race.

7097
11:31:37,810 --> 11:31:40,404
What? I wanna see
what the kid's got.

7098
11:31:47,186 --> 11:31:48,676
Can he drive?

7099
11:31:49,788 --> 11:31:51,255
Can he drive?

7100
11:31:53,259 --> 11:31:55,386
You know what DK stands for?

7101
11:31:56,362 --> 11:31:57,761
Donkey Kong?

7102
11:31:58,197 --> 11:31:59,562
Drift King.

7103
11:32:01,200 --> 11:32:02,360
Drift?

7104
11:32:03,335 --> 11:32:05,303
What do you mean, drift?

7105
11:32:18,017 --> 11:32:19,507
Still need a dictionary?

7106
11:32:20,452 --> 11:32:22,079
You know that
real famous painting?

7107
11:32:22,154 --> 11:32:24,554
The one of the woman
who's smiling all the time?

7108
11:32:24,623 --> 11:32:25,612
The Mona Lisa.

7109
11:32:25,691 --> 11:32:26,817
Right, right, right.
Mona Lisa.

7110
11:32:26,892 --> 11:32:28,484
Well, look, man,
this car right here's...

7111
11:32:28,561 --> 11:32:30,188
like the Mona Lisa
of the drift world.

7112
11:32:30,362 --> 11:32:33,092
Han rebuilt this bad boy
from ground up.

7113
11:32:33,165 --> 11:32:34,632
We talking forged pistons,

7114
11:32:34,700 --> 11:32:37,965
bigger turbo,
new rods, new crankshaft.

7115
11:32:38,704 --> 11:32:42,003
Hey, man, Han's labor
ain't cheap, man, you feel me?

7116
11:32:43,042 --> 11:32:46,307
Well, if I needed a 30-second
lesson on how to drift...

7117
11:32:46,378 --> 11:32:48,869
All right, look, man, there's lots
of ways you can do this, all right?

7118
11:32:48,948 --> 11:32:50,040
Hand braking is the easiest,

7119
11:32:50,115 --> 11:32:51,173
so the first thing
I want you to do,

7120
11:32:51,250 --> 11:32:52,478
I want you to rip that e-brake.

7121
11:32:52,551 --> 11:32:53,677
All right,
after you rip the e-brake,

7122
11:32:53,752 --> 11:32:55,549
then I want you to power over.

7123
11:32:57,356 --> 11:32:58,550
You know what?

7124
11:32:58,624 --> 11:33:00,148
Just don't mess up Mona,
all right?

7125
11:33:00,626 --> 11:33:01,957
All right.

7126
11:33:55,914 --> 11:33:57,074
Ready.

7127
11:33:58,517 --> 11:33:59,575
Set.

7128
11:34:02,488 --> 11:34:03,512
Go!

7129
11:34:44,296 --> 11:34:45,661
I told you.

7130
11:35:26,605 --> 11:35:27,731
Damn it!

7131
11:36:14,520 --> 11:36:15,680
Damn it!

7132
11:37:57,322 --> 11:37:58,949
Don't leave town.

7133
11:38:14,673 --> 11:38:16,800
Do you know what time it is?

7134
11:38:16,942 --> 11:38:19,137
I thought it was around 7:00.

7135
11:38:19,845 --> 11:38:22,507
You know,
US is a few hours behind.

7136
11:38:25,417 --> 11:38:28,352
Looks like the party
was better here, anyway.

7137
11:38:31,223 --> 11:38:33,316
Have you been racing, Sean?

7138
11:38:37,396 --> 11:38:39,125
You're out of here.

7139
11:38:42,634 --> 11:38:43,896
Go ahead.

7140
11:38:45,504 --> 11:38:47,199
You don't get it, do you?

7141
11:38:47,272 --> 11:38:49,399
You have nowhere else to go.

7142
11:38:49,808 --> 11:38:51,139
If it doesn't work out here,

7143
11:38:51,209 --> 11:38:53,234
you're going to jail.
Do you get that?

7144
11:38:56,715 --> 11:38:58,182
This isn't a game.

7145
11:38:58,684 --> 11:39:00,879
And I'm gonna tell you
one more time,

7146
11:39:00,953 --> 11:39:02,614
if you're gonna
live under my roof,

7147
11:39:02,688 --> 11:39:05,589
you're gonna go by
my rules or get out.

7148
11:39:06,391 --> 11:39:07,756
Understand?

7149
11:39:08,927 --> 11:39:10,485
Understand?

7150
11:39:11,396 --> 11:39:12,658
Yes, sir.

7151
11:40:03,315 --> 11:40:04,543
Get in.

7152
11:40:05,183 --> 11:40:07,151
I'll get you your money.

7153
11:40:07,686 --> 11:40:10,382
Why you talking
like you have a choice?

7154
11:40:24,036 --> 11:40:25,628
There's a guy in there
with a paw...

7155
11:40:25,704 --> 11:40:27,501
that owes me some money.

7156
11:40:27,572 --> 11:40:28,732
A paw?

7157
11:40:30,275 --> 11:40:32,038
Go get me my money.

7158
11:40:34,846 --> 11:40:36,211
Okay.

7159
11:41:30,001 --> 11:41:32,367
Han said,

7160
11:41:34,039 --> 11:41:35,506
okane.

7161
11:41:43,615 --> 11:41:46,106
Han said, okane.

7162
11:42:15,046 --> 11:42:16,343
Let's go.

7163
11:42:24,322 --> 11:42:27,382
You're in the pickup
and delivery business now.

7164
11:42:27,459 --> 11:42:30,053
I might call you once a week
or once an hour.

7165
11:42:30,128 --> 11:42:31,686
I don't care
if you're sick as a dog...

7166
11:42:31,763 --> 11:42:33,458
or in bed with Beyoncé.

7167
11:42:33,532 --> 11:42:35,159
I call, you show.

7168
11:42:36,268 --> 11:42:38,099
Only if you teach me
how to drift.

7169
11:42:38,236 --> 11:42:40,101
This ain't a negotiation.

7170
11:42:40,505 --> 11:42:42,302
I wasn't negotiating.

7171
11:43:30,755 --> 11:43:32,586
What's he doing here?

7172
11:43:32,657 --> 11:43:34,682
He's paying me back for
that crumpled beer can...

7173
11:43:34,759 --> 11:43:36,624
sitting in my garage.

7174
11:43:36,695 --> 11:43:38,560
Hope he's not driving.

7175
11:43:41,666 --> 11:43:42,860
Gaijin.

7176
11:43:44,102 --> 11:43:45,763
When is your next race?

7177
11:43:45,904 --> 11:43:47,565
I'd really like to be there.

7178
11:43:49,140 --> 11:43:50,573
Why not be in it?

7179
11:43:55,747 --> 11:43:57,214
You heard me.

7180
11:43:58,149 --> 11:44:00,447
Ready to lose another car, Han?

7181
11:44:00,852 --> 11:44:04,049
I'm ready to take that
'86 Corolla off your hands.

7182
11:44:05,957 --> 11:44:07,288
All right.

7183
11:44:07,626 --> 11:44:09,526
Put up the '72 Skyline.

7184
11:44:10,662 --> 11:44:11,754
Done.

7185
11:44:13,798 --> 11:44:15,925
What do you think,
Morimoto, huh?

7186
11:44:19,371 --> 11:44:21,134
Get him out of here.

7187
11:44:21,940 --> 11:44:24,067
We have business to discuss.

7188
11:44:34,119 --> 11:44:35,950
Your shipment's late.

7189
11:44:36,021 --> 11:44:39,149
Since when are you
so worried about the details?

7190
11:44:41,026 --> 11:44:43,517
When is
the shipment arriving, Han?

7191
11:44:45,030 --> 11:44:47,624
Just sit pretty
and let me handle it.

7192
11:45:09,621 --> 11:45:11,282
Hey, Dad, it's me.

7193
11:45:11,589 --> 11:45:12,749
Uh, I had to stay after school...

7194
11:45:12,824 --> 11:45:14,689
for some extracurricular activities.

7195
11:45:15,927 --> 11:45:17,690
So I'll be home a little later.

7196
11:45:20,398 --> 11:45:21,456
Sir.

7197
11:45:23,835 --> 11:45:26,770
You really need to stop
following me around.

7198
11:45:26,871 --> 11:45:28,839
What are you doing here?

7199
11:45:29,107 --> 11:45:31,041
I thought I'd stop by
and ask your boyfriend

7200
11:45:31,109 --> 11:45:32,599
for some drifting lessons.

7201
11:45:33,745 --> 11:45:34,905
Trust me.

7202
11:45:34,980 --> 11:45:36,777
You don't wanna be
a part of this world.

7203
11:45:37,449 --> 11:45:39,178
It's good enough for you.

7204
11:45:39,250 --> 11:45:41,241
You don't know anything about me.

7205
11:45:41,319 --> 11:45:43,617
Well, why don't you think I know?

7206
11:45:43,688 --> 11:45:46,088
'Cause I'm a gaijin? An outsider?

7207
11:45:47,726 --> 11:45:49,193
Let me guess.

7208
11:45:49,728 --> 11:45:52,390
You're an army brat
who moved around a lot.

7209
11:45:52,464 --> 11:45:54,955
Your mama and daddy
was never home.

7210
11:45:55,033 --> 11:45:58,002
So you walked around
pissed off all the time.

7211
11:45:58,069 --> 11:46:01,402
And now you found your family
with these drift nuts.

7212
11:46:05,110 --> 11:46:06,907
Zero for one, cowboy.

7213
11:46:18,623 --> 11:46:20,682
Why can't you go find
a nice Japanese girl

7214
11:46:20,759 --> 11:46:22,420
like the rest of
the white guys around here?

7215
11:46:28,400 --> 11:46:30,664
Is everything okay back there?

7216
11:46:31,436 --> 11:46:33,028
I can handle DK.

7217
11:46:34,005 --> 11:46:35,870
I thought he's Yakuza.

7218
11:46:36,541 --> 11:46:38,270
His uncle's Yakuza.

7219
11:46:39,310 --> 11:46:42,746
He's just playing gangster
in his little storage room.

7220
11:46:45,617 --> 11:46:47,175
But I need him.

7221
11:46:47,919 --> 11:46:51,116
He keeps Uncle Kamata
from poking around too much.

7222
11:46:51,623 --> 11:46:53,284
What do you mean?

7223
11:46:54,292 --> 11:46:56,226
Well, his uncle gets
a piece of the action

7224
11:46:56,294 --> 11:46:57,921
from everyone on his turf.

7225
11:46:57,996 --> 11:46:59,657
We're on his turf.

7226
11:47:00,899 --> 11:47:02,560
50% of something is better than

7227
11:47:02,634 --> 11:47:04,295
100% of nothing.

7228
11:47:06,638 --> 11:47:08,469
So have you raced DK?

7229
11:47:09,207 --> 11:47:11,334
Why not? Is he that good?

7230
11:47:11,843 --> 11:47:13,936
What's the point of a race?

7231
11:47:14,979 --> 11:47:17,447
To see if I'm better
than the other guy.

7232
11:47:17,515 --> 11:47:19,540
Just proves you're faster,
that's all.

7233
11:47:19,617 --> 11:47:21,084
If I were to race,
it would have to be

7234
11:47:21,152 --> 11:47:23,052
for something important.

7235
11:47:23,121 --> 11:47:25,112
Or why else do it at all?

7236
11:47:27,425 --> 11:47:29,393
Why are you letting me race?

7237
11:47:29,461 --> 11:47:31,691
'Cause you're DK's kryptonite.

7238
11:47:33,198 --> 11:47:34,995
And you owe me a car.

7239
11:47:57,689 --> 11:47:58,781
Oh, shit.

7240
11:48:06,297 --> 11:48:07,491
What the...

7241
11:48:07,565 --> 11:48:10,159
Police cars here are
only factory-tuned.

7242
11:48:10,235 --> 11:48:11,725
You can do better than 180k,

7243
11:48:11,803 --> 11:48:14,101
they can't catch you,
so they don't even try.

7244
11:48:16,875 --> 11:48:18,399
You know what?

7245
11:48:18,476 --> 11:48:20,341
I'm beginning to like
this country already.

7246
11:48:36,327 --> 11:48:37,487
Danny!

7247
11:48:38,429 --> 11:48:40,192
You're looking good.

7248
11:48:43,368 --> 11:48:44,528
Disco.

7249
11:48:51,442 --> 11:48:52,704
We gotta catch up.

7250
11:48:52,777 --> 11:48:54,267
Get you a drink on me, huh?

7251
11:48:54,345 --> 11:48:55,607
Let's go.

7252
11:49:08,927 --> 11:49:11,862
Aha. Easy now, ladies.

7253
11:49:14,832 --> 11:49:16,060
Come on.

7254
11:49:19,837 --> 11:49:22,203
What's up? How you doing?

7255
11:49:22,273 --> 11:49:23,604
Hey, baby.

7256
11:49:42,126 --> 11:49:43,821
Keep your hands off the kid, girls.

7257
11:49:43,895 --> 11:49:45,385
He's underage.

7258
11:49:47,532 --> 11:49:49,363
Ladies, ladies, ladies.

7259
11:49:49,734 --> 11:49:51,429
Disneyland for grownups, huh?

7260
11:49:51,502 --> 11:49:52,935
All these girls, man,
they look like...

7261
11:49:53,004 --> 11:49:54,403
What, models?

7262
11:49:54,472 --> 11:49:55,530
Check it out.

7263
11:49:55,607 --> 11:49:57,370
See,
Tokyo is the fashion capital...

7264
11:49:57,442 --> 11:49:58,807
on this side of the planet,
all right?

7265
11:49:58,876 --> 11:50:00,309
Now, imagine
you been posing all day.

7266
11:50:00,378 --> 11:50:01,777
I mean,
that's a lot of hard work.

7267
11:50:01,846 --> 11:50:03,438
Not only do you get tired,
but, on top of that,

7268
11:50:03,514 --> 11:50:05,004
you wanna have a little fun,
but you can't

7269
11:50:05,083 --> 11:50:07,074
'cause you don't even know
nobody in town.

7270
11:50:07,151 --> 11:50:08,584
And most of
the guys around here are

7271
11:50:08,653 --> 11:50:10,382
too chicken shit
to even try picking up one.

7272
11:50:10,455 --> 11:50:12,116
So what do you do?

7273
11:50:13,024 --> 11:50:16,221
Man, you talk to the little
dude who makes you laugh.

7274
11:50:16,294 --> 11:50:17,386
Yeah.

7275
11:50:18,296 --> 11:50:20,423
Look, man, I don't just think
outside the box.

7276
11:50:20,498 --> 11:50:22,022
I tear it up.

7277
11:50:22,100 --> 11:50:23,692
That's my thing.

7278
11:50:23,835 --> 11:50:24,824
Yo.

7279
11:50:31,909 --> 11:50:33,001
Sean!

7280
11:51:18,022 --> 11:51:19,751
The red Evo's yours.

7281
11:51:31,769 --> 11:51:33,396
What do you mean?

7282
11:51:34,205 --> 11:51:35,832
You're representing me now.

7283
11:51:35,907 --> 11:51:38,432
What you think, I'm gonna
let you roll in a Hyundai?

7284
11:52:04,736 --> 11:52:05,964
Oh, man.

7285
11:52:11,509 --> 11:52:12,498
Damn it.

7286
11:52:18,116 --> 11:52:20,175
My mother,
she's blind in one eye

7287
11:52:20,251 --> 11:52:22,082
and she can drift
better than that.

7288
11:52:24,722 --> 11:52:26,815
Han, where did you find this guy?

7289
11:52:28,025 --> 11:52:30,755
Will someone please teach
this guy how to drift?

7290
11:52:53,900 --> 11:52:55,424
Is that yours?

7291
11:52:56,436 --> 11:52:57,698
Sure is.

7292
11:53:05,278 --> 11:53:06,540
What happened?

7293
11:53:07,814 --> 11:53:11,215
I don't know. I found
it this way at the base.

7294
11:53:15,221 --> 11:53:16,688
It's got potential.

7295
11:53:21,594 --> 11:53:23,926
Yeah, maybe. We'll see.

7296
11:53:28,701 --> 11:53:31,534
You know, Sean,
the Japanese have a saying.

7297
11:53:34,674 --> 11:53:37,142
"The nail that sticks out
gets hammered."

7298
11:53:41,180 --> 11:53:42,977
You're gonna be late.

7299
11:53:54,594 --> 11:53:55,754
Sean!

7300
11:54:17,850 --> 11:54:19,647
Come on, man, you broke it.

7301
11:54:24,857 --> 11:54:25,949
Hey, whoa, whoa.

7302
11:54:26,993 --> 11:54:29,154
There must be a misunderstanding.

7303
11:54:29,829 --> 11:54:32,992
Out of my way, or you're next.

7304
11:54:33,066 --> 11:54:34,124
Take it easy.

7305
11:54:34,200 --> 11:54:35,997
Look, man, I don't
do refunds, all right?

7306
11:54:36,069 --> 11:54:38,367
Okay, let's go, then!
Let's go!

7307
11:54:38,671 --> 11:54:40,104
Touch me again...

7308
11:54:43,810 --> 11:54:44,902
Here.

7309
11:54:46,012 --> 11:54:48,037
Try not to break this one.

7310
11:55:02,428 --> 11:55:03,417
Say, man!

7311
11:55:03,496 --> 11:55:05,054
What the hell is
wrong with you, huh?

7312
11:55:05,131 --> 11:55:07,964
Now everybody's gonna want
exchanges around here.

7313
11:55:08,034 --> 11:55:09,126
Damn!

7314
11:55:21,714 --> 11:55:24,046
Not easy saving the day, is it?

7315
11:55:24,817 --> 11:55:27,718
Maybe you could give me
some pointers sometime.

7316
11:55:27,787 --> 11:55:29,448
You're doing all right.

7317
11:55:30,556 --> 11:55:31,750
Thanks.

7318
11:55:35,261 --> 11:55:36,319
Hey.

7319
11:55:37,530 --> 11:55:38,622
Yeah?

7320
11:55:39,665 --> 11:55:41,792
Sorry about the other night.

7321
11:55:42,402 --> 11:55:44,734
Your life isn't any of my business.

7322
11:55:46,339 --> 11:55:47,704
It's okay.

7323
11:56:10,029 --> 11:56:11,121
Foul!

7324
11:56:12,031 --> 11:56:13,828
- Ain't no damn foul.
- That was a foul.

7325
11:56:13,900 --> 11:56:15,299
- Yo, you in my face.
- That was a foul.

7326
11:56:15,368 --> 11:56:17,893
Hey, Han, sort this wanker out.

7327
11:56:17,970 --> 11:56:19,198
A wanker?

7328
11:56:19,305 --> 11:56:21,500
What do I look like, a zebra?

7329
11:56:28,214 --> 11:56:30,774
So, how did you end up
over here, anyway?

7330
11:56:31,918 --> 11:56:34,318
Well, you know
those old Westerns...

7331
11:56:35,021 --> 11:56:37,922
where the cowboys
make a run for the border?

7332
11:56:40,593 --> 11:56:42,288
This is my Mexico.

7333
11:56:45,998 --> 11:56:48,523
Why'd you let me
race with your car?

7334
11:56:48,668 --> 11:56:50,898
You knew I was gonna wreck it.

7335
11:56:51,504 --> 11:56:52,732
Why not?

7336
11:56:53,973 --> 11:56:56,066
'Cause it's a lot of money.

7337
11:56:56,175 --> 11:56:57,642
I have money.

7338
11:56:59,011 --> 11:57:01,844
It's trust and character
I need around me.

7339
11:57:03,516 --> 11:57:05,575
You know, who you
choose to be around you...

7340
11:57:05,651 --> 11:57:07,676
lets you know who you are.

7341
11:57:09,722 --> 11:57:11,383
And one car in exchange
for knowing...

7342
11:57:11,457 --> 11:57:13,186
what a man's made of,

7343
11:57:13,626 --> 11:57:15,924
that's a price I can live with.

7344
11:57:20,133 --> 11:57:22,693
Look at all those
people down there.

7345
11:57:23,369 --> 11:57:25,701
They follow the rules, for what?

7346
11:57:26,973 --> 11:57:29,271
They're letting fear lead them.

7347
11:57:31,210 --> 11:57:33,303
What happens if they don't?

7348
11:57:34,046 --> 11:57:36,139
Life's simple.

7349
11:57:36,482 --> 11:57:38,746
You make choices
and you don't look back.

7350
11:57:53,332 --> 11:57:54,993
So, if you don't drift to win,

7351
11:57:55,067 --> 11:57:57,035
what do you drift for?

7352
11:57:57,503 --> 11:57:58,731
You really want to know?

7353
11:57:58,871 --> 11:58:00,133
Yeah.

7354
11:58:00,973 --> 11:58:02,497
Okay. Let's go.

7355
11:59:19,919 --> 11:59:22,444
There's no "wax on,
wax off" with drifting.

7356
11:59:22,888 --> 11:59:24,287
Learn by doin' it.

7357
11:59:25,224 --> 11:59:26,748
The first drifters
invented drifting...

7358
11:59:26,826 --> 11:59:28,589
out here in the mountains
by feeling it.

7359
11:59:29,729 --> 11:59:31,094
So feel it.

7360
11:59:43,643 --> 11:59:44,803
Again!

7361
11:59:47,213 --> 11:59:48,373
What's in this bag?

7362
11:59:48,948 --> 11:59:50,006
You'll see.

7363
11:59:50,516 --> 11:59:51,949
How much you got?

7364
11:59:52,018 --> 11:59:53,451
Keep going, keep going.

7365
11:59:59,625 --> 12:00:02,185
I'm so good, man, I could
sell rubbers to a monk.

7366
12:00:07,166 --> 12:00:08,155
Again.

7367
12:00:30,323 --> 12:00:31,483
Again.

7368
12:00:40,933 --> 12:00:43,766
Watch it. Watch it.
Not too early, now.

7369
12:00:49,075 --> 12:00:51,475
Go, go, go, go!

7370
12:01:02,822 --> 12:01:04,722
Don't lose it! Don't lose it!

7371
12:01:56,375 --> 12:01:59,811
Hey, Twink.
Get this man a bunk.

7372
12:03:14,653 --> 12:03:16,348
Pleasure doing business.

7373
12:03:20,192 --> 12:03:23,184
Yeah, baby. I told you.
I told you, didn't I?

7374
12:03:29,800 --> 12:03:32,644
They say if you want to
glimpse the future,

7375
12:03:32,800 --> 12:03:35,087
just look behind you.

7376
12:03:36,000 --> 12:03:38,970
I used to think
that was bollocks.

7377
12:03:39,800 --> 12:03:42,201
But now I realize

7378
12:03:46,520 --> 12:03:49,046
you can't outrun the past.

7379
12:03:54,040 --> 12:03:56,202
When we were kids,

7380
12:03:56,800 --> 12:04:00,168
you'd start fights
with the toughest
bastards in the yard.

7381
12:04:01,800 --> 12:04:05,407
But I was the one
who had to step in
and finish them.

7382
12:04:07,760 --> 12:04:10,445
You'd steal from
the corner shop,

7383
12:04:11,400 --> 12:04:12,970
but it was me

7384
12:04:13,920 --> 12:04:16,082
who'd brave the old man's belt.

7385
12:04:18,760 --> 12:04:20,888
I'd hoped you'd outgrown it.

7386
12:04:22,080 --> 12:04:23,844
That playing the gangster

7387
12:04:24,480 --> 12:04:29,611
made you harder,
smarter, better.

7388
12:04:30,640 --> 12:04:34,167
But deep down,
I guess I always knew
you'd end up like this,

7389
12:04:34,240 --> 12:04:37,084
despite everything
I did teach you.

7390
12:04:37,880 --> 12:04:39,166
Still,

7391
12:04:40,240 --> 12:04:41,924
you're my flesh and blood.

7392
12:04:42,000 --> 12:04:46,289
So you remain my cross to bear.

7393
12:04:59,880 --> 12:05:02,247
Rest now, little brother,

7394
12:05:02,400 --> 12:05:05,051
while I settle
your one last score.

7395
12:05:11,160 --> 12:05:13,731
You take care of my brother.

7396
12:05:13,920 --> 12:05:15,729
Anything happens to him,

7397
12:05:15,920 --> 12:05:17,729
I'll come by looking for you.

7398
12:06:08,120 --> 12:06:09,645
Here. Hold this.

7399
12:06:09,920 --> 12:06:10,921
Grenade!

7400
12:07:22,000 --> 12:07:24,367
Come on, Dom.
So where are you
taking me?

7401
12:07:25,520 --> 12:07:28,000
They say an open road
helps you think

7402
12:07:28,960 --> 12:07:32,681
about where you've been,
where you're going.

7403
12:07:35,040 --> 12:07:37,168
So you don't remember
any of this yet?

7404
12:07:37,280 --> 12:07:39,521
That's not fair.

7405
12:07:39,680 --> 12:07:42,160
You know I don't.

7406
12:07:45,800 --> 12:07:48,007
So what is it exactly
that you're trying to
show me?

7407
12:07:49,200 --> 12:07:50,440
That.

7408
12:07:54,960 --> 12:07:56,041
Race Wars.

7409
12:07:58,280 --> 12:07:59,850
We used to come here?

7410
12:08:00,000 --> 12:08:01,001
"Come here?"

7411
12:08:01,680 --> 12:08:02,761
We invented it.

7412
12:08:45,320 --> 12:08:47,004
Keep it under 9,000 RPMs.

7413
12:08:47,160 --> 12:08:49,731
Kid's gonna fry his pistons
after the first 200.

7414
12:08:51,840 --> 12:08:54,080
You know that's not my style.
I gotta ride or die, right?

7415
12:08:56,240 --> 12:08:57,890
How about you just ride
on this one?

7416
12:09:16,600 --> 12:09:17,601
Are you ready?

7417
12:09:20,400 --> 12:09:21,606
I know you're ready!

7418
12:09:35,720 --> 12:09:36,960
Go!

7419
12:10:20,880 --> 12:10:23,042
Hey, nice job.

7420
12:10:26,520 --> 12:10:27,521
Hey!

7421
12:10:28,120 --> 12:10:30,361
That's the girl
I heard so much about.

7422
12:10:30,520 --> 12:10:32,488
Where you been at, ghost girl?

7423
12:10:38,480 --> 12:10:39,600
<i>Ghost girl.</i>

7424
12:10:49,760 --> 12:10:51,000
Letty, what the hell?

7425
12:10:51,120 --> 12:10:52,121
Huh?

7426
12:10:57,200 --> 12:11:00,488
Damn, dawg!
Girl's still got
that swing, homie.

7427
12:11:02,240 --> 12:11:04,481
You never could take a punch.

7428
12:11:06,240 --> 12:11:07,526
Right, right.

7429
12:11:07,680 --> 12:11:09,170
Hey, man.
I'm glad you're back, man.

7430
12:11:09,240 --> 12:11:10,480
It's good to see you!

7431
12:11:10,640 --> 12:11:12,529
Good to see you, Hector.

7432
12:11:31,240 --> 12:11:33,561
All right.
We made it, Jack.

7433
12:11:33,800 --> 12:11:35,962
Yeah, we made it!
Yeah, we made it.

7434
12:11:36,040 --> 12:11:38,122
Now I just gotta find
that door button.

7435
12:11:38,200 --> 12:11:40,328
Buddy, where's the door
button at? Do you know?

7436
12:11:40,400 --> 12:11:41,561
Hi.
Hey.

7437
12:11:43,640 --> 12:11:45,802
Yeah, of course.
I'm new to this.

7438
12:11:45,880 --> 12:11:47,291
Yeah, you don't seem
like the minivan type.

7439
12:11:47,360 --> 12:11:48,441
No, not exactly.

7440
12:11:48,520 --> 12:11:49,601
Hey, buddy, you gonna
give me a high five?

7441
12:11:49,680 --> 12:11:51,205
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait, high five!

7442
12:11:51,280 --> 12:11:52,611
All right. Yeah, buddy.

7443
12:11:52,680 --> 12:11:53,680
Appreciate it. Thank you.

7444
12:11:53,720 --> 12:11:55,600
Don't worry. You'll get
used to this in no time.

7445
12:11:57,920 --> 12:11:59,729
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

7446
12:12:32,120 --> 12:12:33,565
First time I saw this,

7447
12:12:35,600 --> 12:12:37,602
I thought it was kind of funny.

7448
12:12:41,440 --> 12:12:43,647
I guess now the joke's on me.

7449
12:12:45,120 --> 12:12:46,360
What are you doing?

7450
12:12:48,080 --> 12:12:51,129
What I should've done
a long time ago.

7451
12:12:51,400 --> 12:12:53,004
LETTYI Stop it!

7452
12:12:54,640 --> 12:12:56,290
Look at it.

7453
12:12:56,480 --> 12:12:57,606
It's the truth.

7454
12:12:59,280 --> 12:13:02,443
That's the date
that I lost my memory.

7455
12:13:02,600 --> 12:13:05,524
That's the date that Letty died

7456
12:13:06,600 --> 12:13:08,364
and I was born.
No.

7457
12:13:09,320 --> 12:13:10,320
You never died.

7458
12:13:10,360 --> 12:13:12,647
Do you know how hard it is
for me when you look at me

7459
12:13:13,000 --> 12:13:15,810
and you see me through
15 years of memories?

7460
12:13:17,360 --> 12:13:19,647
Every beautiful moment
we've ever had.

7461
12:13:19,960 --> 12:13:21,962
I see it in your eyes.

7462
12:13:22,360 --> 12:13:24,647
I can't give that to you.

7463
12:13:25,160 --> 12:13:27,049
I got nothing.

7464
12:13:27,200 --> 12:13:28,201
You got me.

7465
12:13:29,760 --> 12:13:31,603
And you've got
only a piece of me.

7466
12:13:33,320 --> 12:13:35,527
I have to find myself.

7467
12:13:35,680 --> 12:13:37,011
For me.

7468
12:13:52,480 --> 12:13:53,686
Goodbye, Dom.

7469
12:14:15,000 --> 12:14:17,048
You're disappointed, aren't you?

7470
12:14:17,880 --> 12:14:19,370
What are you talking about?

7471
12:14:19,560 --> 12:14:20,846
The last arrest.

7472
12:14:21,000 --> 12:14:23,890
He was too easy.
Target didn't even run.

7473
12:14:24,040 --> 12:14:25,246
Ah, it's okay.

7474
12:14:25,440 --> 12:14:27,522
Gives me a chance
to hit the iron.

7475
12:14:27,680 --> 12:14:30,604
Also lets me work on
my stamping skills.

7476
12:14:32,520 --> 12:14:34,363
You're a terrible liar.

7477
12:14:35,280 --> 12:14:36,406
See you tomorrow, boss.

7478
12:14:36,560 --> 12:14:38,369
I'll see you then.
Don't stay too late.

7479
12:14:38,520 --> 12:14:40,363
I'll stay as long
as I want, woman.

7480
12:14:40,520 --> 12:14:42,284
I knew you would say that.

7481
12:14:54,880 --> 12:14:55,881
Elena?

7482
12:15:03,480 --> 12:15:05,084
What's this?

7483
12:15:05,240 --> 12:15:07,080
It's the letter
of recommendation
you asked for.

7484
12:15:08,040 --> 12:15:10,646
Just know I meant
every word in there.

7485
12:15:12,440 --> 12:15:14,169
Thanks, Hobbs.

7486
12:15:14,320 --> 12:15:16,129
Thanks for everything.

7487
12:15:18,920 --> 12:15:21,730
Come on, way too
sentimental right now.

7488
12:15:21,800 --> 12:15:22,881
Get home. Good night.

7489
12:15:23,000 --> 12:15:24,604
Okay. Good night.

7490
12:15:59,280 --> 12:16:00,566
Just one sec.

7491
12:16:05,120 --> 12:16:07,088
You sure as hell
ain't the IT guy.

7492
12:16:07,160 --> 12:16:08,240
So you better start talking

7493
12:16:08,320 --> 12:16:10,641
before I break that finger
six different ways

7494
12:16:10,720 --> 12:16:13,166
and stick it
right where the sun
doesn't shine.

7495
12:16:15,400 --> 12:16:17,368
Agent Hobbs, right?

7496
12:16:18,160 --> 12:16:19,446
That's right.

7497
12:16:20,000 --> 12:16:21,923
I'm also the last man on Earth

7498
12:16:22,000 --> 12:16:23,809
whose computer you want
to be hacking into.

7499
12:16:24,080 --> 12:16:27,129
You just earned yourself
a dance with the devil, boy.

7500
12:16:27,480 --> 12:16:28,641
You're under arrest.

7501
12:16:28,760 --> 12:16:30,922
I don't care about
your computer.

7502
12:16:31,440 --> 12:16:33,841
I'm here for the team
that crippled my brother.

7503
12:16:35,440 --> 12:16:36,805
There ain't no goddamn team.

7504
12:16:36,880 --> 12:16:40,441
It was just one man,
and he's standing
right in front of you.

7505
12:16:49,000 --> 12:16:50,570
The lady was right.

7506
12:16:52,240 --> 12:16:53,685
You are a terrible liar.

7507
12:17:54,880 --> 12:17:56,325
Goddamn IT guys.

7508
12:18:10,360 --> 12:18:11,600
Hobbs!

7509
12:18:12,400 --> 12:18:13,526
On me!

7510
12:18:23,280 --> 12:18:24,930
Elena!

7511
12:18:46,120 --> 12:18:47,281
Hobbs?

7512
12:18:48,760 --> 12:18:49,841
Hobbs!

7513
12:19:49,100 --> 12:19:51,000
It's actually not bad.

7514
12:19:51,136 --> 12:19:53,036
I didn't even have
to put ketchup on it.

7515
12:19:54,105 --> 12:19:56,232
See, I'm not a total gaijin.

7516
12:19:58,042 --> 12:19:59,532
I hate that word.

7517
12:19:59,978 --> 12:20:02,037
It's what they used
to call me when I was a kid.

7518
12:20:03,548 --> 12:20:05,743
I thought you were born here.

7519
12:20:05,817 --> 12:20:08,911
Well, "outsider" can mean
many different things.

7520
12:20:14,225 --> 12:20:16,250
My mom died when I was 10.

7521
12:20:17,629 --> 12:20:19,256
She came out here
from Australia...

7522
12:20:19,330 --> 12:20:20,991
when she finished high school.

7523
12:20:21,199 --> 12:20:22,530
And all I know
about her is that...

7524
12:20:22,600 --> 12:20:25,296
she went to work in a hostess bar.

7525
12:20:28,439 --> 12:20:30,566
DK's grandmother took me in.

7526
12:20:33,711 --> 12:20:36,612
Well, my parents
split up when I was three.

7527
12:20:37,816 --> 12:20:39,579
Me and Mom moved around a lot.

7528
12:20:40,385 --> 12:20:42,148
Mostly 'cause of me.

7529
12:20:43,154 --> 12:20:45,486
Well, it was all 'cause of me.

7530
12:20:47,425 --> 12:20:49,893
Kind of made myself
an outsider, you know,

7531
12:20:50,128 --> 12:20:52,426
without even thinking about it.

7532
12:20:54,532 --> 12:20:55,692
But I realize now,

7533
12:20:55,767 --> 12:20:58,167
outsider or insider,
it doesn't really matter.

7534
12:20:59,337 --> 12:21:02,431
All that matters is knowing
what you really want

7535
12:21:03,408 --> 12:21:05,137
and going after it.

7536
12:21:25,263 --> 12:21:28,061
We used to come up here
when we were kids.

7537
12:21:28,533 --> 12:21:31,866
Even before we could drive
we'd cut class, sneak out,

7538
12:21:31,936 --> 12:21:34,496
come up here, and watch
the older kids drift.

7539
12:21:41,212 --> 12:21:43,237
Things were different back then.

7540
12:21:47,285 --> 12:21:50,118
Once I got my license,
I practically lived up here.

7541
12:21:50,722 --> 12:21:53,282
Back then, kids just drove
whatever they had.

7542
12:21:53,458 --> 12:21:54,720
You know, we just made do.

7543
12:21:54,859 --> 12:21:56,121
No one bothered us.

7544
12:21:57,562 --> 12:21:59,086
The day I got my license...

7545
12:21:59,163 --> 12:22:01,654
is the day I got
my first speeding ticket.

7546
12:22:01,733 --> 12:22:04,133
The day after that,
I won my first race.

7547
12:22:04,636 --> 12:22:07,196
I beat this rich kid
by three lengths.

7548
12:22:08,206 --> 12:22:10,936
I gotta admit, it felt good.

7549
12:22:12,744 --> 12:22:14,041
It felt like...

7550
12:22:14,312 --> 12:22:16,542
Like everything else
just disappears.

7551
12:22:18,549 --> 12:22:20,039
No past and no future.

7552
12:22:20,585 --> 12:22:22,109
No problems.

7553
12:22:24,088 --> 12:22:25,680
Just the moment.

7554
12:22:49,213 --> 12:22:50,840
Boy needs to chill.

7555
12:22:53,351 --> 12:22:55,546
Hey, Twink,
I'm gonna grab another set.

7556
12:22:55,620 --> 12:22:57,884
Whoa! Whoa,
whoa, whoa! Another set?

7557
12:22:58,156 --> 12:23:00,750
No. Look, that was
your third set today.

7558
12:23:00,825 --> 12:23:02,850
I mean, them tires ain't cheap.

7559
12:23:12,704 --> 12:23:14,399
DK, grab a chair.

7560
12:23:14,539 --> 12:23:16,268
We're about to
roast some marshmallows.

7561
12:23:17,308 --> 12:23:19,037
Yo, come on, man, look...

7562
12:23:31,389 --> 12:23:33,118
Stay away from her,

7563
12:23:33,324 --> 12:23:36,623
or the only thing you'll
be driving is a wheelchair.

7564
12:23:42,667 --> 12:23:44,464
Find yourself a new driver.

7565
12:23:57,281 --> 12:23:58,407
I'm all right.

7566
12:23:58,850 --> 12:24:00,010
What'd you expect?

7567
12:24:00,518 --> 12:24:01,883
You didn't just play with fire,

7568
12:24:01,953 --> 12:24:03,716
you soaked
the matches in gasoline.

7569
12:24:27,578 --> 12:24:28,909
It's over.

7570
12:24:49,667 --> 12:24:51,259
All this over a gaijin?

7571
12:24:51,402 --> 12:24:52,994
I am a gaijin.

7572
12:24:55,907 --> 12:24:57,636
You've changed, DK.

7573
12:25:03,014 --> 12:25:04,811
You say I've changed.

7574
12:25:07,151 --> 12:25:09,779
But we're not so different,
you and I.

7575
12:25:11,055 --> 12:25:13,888
We're both products
of fuckups, aren't we?

7576
12:25:19,897 --> 12:25:23,162
They say your mom
was the best trick...

7577
12:25:23,234 --> 12:25:25,759
in all of Kabukichō
back in the day.

7578
12:25:26,304 --> 12:25:27,931
Leave my mother out of this.

7579
12:25:28,005 --> 12:25:31,406
If we hadn't taken you in,
you'd be just like her,

7580
12:25:32,310 --> 12:25:34,335
doing anything for a buck.

7581
12:25:35,480 --> 12:25:37,209
Think anyone would take
a second look at you...

7582
12:25:37,281 --> 12:25:38,748
if it wasn't for your uncle?

7583
12:25:53,064 --> 12:25:54,929
We're the same, Neela.

7584
12:25:58,836 --> 12:26:01,999
Difference is I know who I am
and where I belong.

7585
12:26:07,912 --> 12:26:09,880
Do you know who you are?

7586
12:26:12,717 --> 12:26:16,209
Do you know where you belong?

7587
12:26:35,473 --> 12:26:36,531
Hey.

7588
12:26:41,579 --> 12:26:42,807
Come on.

7589
12:30:27,772 --> 12:30:29,034
Hey, brother.

7590
12:30:30,040 --> 12:30:31,337
I vouched for you!

7591
12:30:31,409 --> 12:30:33,377
Put my reputation
on the line for you!

7592
12:30:33,477 --> 12:30:34,842
We were partners!

7593
12:30:35,246 --> 12:30:38,113
You think you can keep
your side deals from me?

7594
12:30:38,182 --> 12:30:41,083
Come on.
We ain't in the Boy Scouts.

7595
12:30:41,919 --> 12:30:43,045
This is what we do.

7596
12:30:43,187 --> 12:30:44,347
Takashi!

7597
12:30:51,529 --> 12:30:53,656
What about now? Hmm?

7598
12:30:55,199 --> 12:30:56,928
Is this what we do?

7599
12:30:58,469 --> 12:31:00,096
Man, you need me.

7600
12:31:00,337 --> 12:31:02,168
You'd still be
shaking down teahouses...

7601
12:31:02,239 --> 12:31:03,729
for chump change
if it wasn't for me.

7602
12:31:13,617 --> 12:31:14,777
Get in!

7603
12:31:14,852 --> 12:31:16,183
Go! Go! Go!

7604
12:31:20,257 --> 12:31:21,485
Come on.

7605
12:34:57,400 --> 12:34:58,765
Sean. Sean!

7606
12:35:53,100 --> 12:35:55,340
All right, buddy.
We gotta go.
We're gonna be late.

7607
12:36:04,900 --> 12:36:05,947
Come on.

7608
12:36:07,060 --> 12:36:10,189
Okay, what do you think?

7609
12:36:10,260 --> 12:36:12,149
Parking brake slide
right up to the school?

7610
12:36:12,220 --> 12:36:13,220
Where's Mommy?

7611
12:36:13,260 --> 12:36:15,786
I don't know.
She's up there.
She's coming.

7612
12:36:15,860 --> 12:36:17,100
Oh.

7613
12:36:27,100 --> 12:36:28,261
Here we go.

7614
12:36:28,780 --> 12:36:29,827
Watch your head.

7615
12:36:35,600 --> 12:36:37,329
Dom, you have
a package out here!

7616
12:36:37,520 --> 12:36:38,931
It's from Tokyo.

7617
12:36:50,600 --> 12:36:52,045
Tokyo?

7618
12:36:52,120 --> 12:36:55,283
What? ls Han trying
to convert me over
to a turbocharger?

7619
12:36:55,360 --> 12:36:56,646
All right, you ready?

7620
12:36:58,500 --> 12:36:59,547
There we go.

7621
12:37:00,180 --> 12:37:02,945
Yeah!
Hey, buddy.
Cars don't fly.

7622
12:37:07,100 --> 12:37:08,511
Cars don't fly.

7623
12:37:12,000 --> 12:37:13,240
This one did, huh?

7624
12:37:16,000 --> 12:37:19,322
Brian in a minivan.
Things have changed.

7625
12:37:19,560 --> 12:37:21,722
He's struggling, Dom.

7626
12:37:21,920 --> 12:37:23,331
He doesn't want me to see it,

7627
12:37:23,480 --> 12:37:26,882
but the white picket fence
is like an anchor on him.
I can tell.

7628
12:37:32,100 --> 12:37:35,070
I tried to talk to him
the other night.
You know what he said?

7629
12:37:35,540 --> 12:37:37,941
He doesn't miss the girls,
he doesn't miss the cars.

7630
12:37:38,020 --> 12:37:40,626
He misses the bullets.

7631
12:37:41,220 --> 12:37:43,791
Let him settle in.
Give him time.

7632
12:37:44,220 --> 12:37:45,949
How does nine months sound?

7633
12:37:55,200 --> 12:37:57,487
I'm having another baby.

7634
12:38:02,720 --> 12:38:05,007
And you didn't tell him,
did you?

7635
12:38:13,000 --> 12:38:14,411
You gotta tell him.

7636
12:38:16,800 --> 12:38:19,610
I don't want him to be
disappointed with his life.

7637
12:38:21,640 --> 12:38:23,529
With me.

7638
12:38:32,000 --> 12:38:34,480
He will never be
disappointed with you.

7639
12:38:34,640 --> 12:38:37,211
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to him.

7640
12:38:40,280 --> 12:38:41,327
Thank you.

7641
12:38:57,700 --> 12:38:58,701
Yeah?

7642
12:38:58,780 --> 12:38:59,906
Dominic Toretto.

7643
12:39:00,700 --> 12:39:01,781
You don't know me.

7644
12:39:06,100 --> 12:39:07,431
You're about to.

7645
12:39:13,800 --> 12:39:15,131
Get down!

7646
12:39:38,300 --> 12:39:39,381
Jack!

7647
12:39:44,620 --> 12:39:45,621
Jack!

7648
12:40:41,900 --> 12:40:44,470
Pretty nifty magic trick.

7649
12:40:44,503 --> 12:40:46,539
Yeah, I've done better.

7650
12:40:48,440 --> 12:40:50,510
Now for the hard part.

7651
12:40:52,579 --> 12:40:54,314
Keeping you dead.

7652
12:41:37,700 --> 12:41:38,689
Takashi.

7653
12:41:48,044 --> 12:41:50,205
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

7654
12:42:00,623 --> 12:42:01,715
Okay.

7655
12:42:02,925 --> 12:42:04,324
I'll go with you.

7656
12:42:04,827 --> 12:42:05,987
Neela.

7657
12:42:17,040 --> 12:42:19,372
See you when Daddy's not around.

7658
12:42:42,865 --> 12:42:44,093
I'm putting you on a plane tonight.

7659
12:42:44,167 --> 12:42:45,225
Dad...

7660
12:42:45,301 --> 12:42:46,734
Sean, don't argue with me.

7661
12:42:46,803 --> 12:42:49,601
I did this. I can't run away.

7662
12:42:50,773 --> 12:42:51,797
I can't.

7663
12:42:51,874 --> 12:42:53,501
Sean, I'm your father.

7664
12:42:53,576 --> 12:42:55,510
I'm responsible
for your well-being.

7665
12:42:56,112 --> 12:42:58,137
And I'm responsible
for my mess.

7666
12:43:01,284 --> 12:43:03,081
I gotta do this.

7667
12:43:05,288 --> 12:43:07,256
Can you understand that?

7668
12:43:23,306 --> 12:43:26,036
At least you're not
redoing my mistakes.

7669
12:43:54,771 --> 12:43:56,500
You all right, man?

7670
12:44:00,410 --> 12:44:02,002
We're leaving town.

7671
12:44:02,712 --> 12:44:04,304
Look, I know some people...

7672
12:44:05,815 --> 12:44:07,612
I can't do it, Twink.

7673
12:44:08,551 --> 12:44:11,645
Look, DK wants your head.

7674
12:44:12,522 --> 12:44:13,853
All right?

7675
12:44:14,290 --> 12:44:16,349
And the trouble you
just made for Kamata?

7676
12:44:17,560 --> 12:44:19,619
You're done here, bro.

7677
12:44:21,130 --> 12:44:22,757
Maybe I should talk to Kamata.

7678
12:44:24,000 --> 12:44:25,627
What?

7679
12:44:26,102 --> 12:44:27,763
DK answers to him.

7680
12:44:30,540 --> 12:44:32,838
I know I just didn't hear that.

7681
12:44:34,844 --> 12:44:38,245
I gotta end this.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

7682
12:44:38,314 --> 12:44:40,305
What, are you crazy, huh?

7683
12:44:40,516 --> 12:44:42,108
Han is dead, all right!

7684
12:44:42,185 --> 12:44:45,177
Plus, you can't just walk
into Kamata's place, man!

7685
12:44:48,324 --> 12:44:49,848
It's all I got.

7686
12:44:56,432 --> 12:44:59,629
Something I think Han
would've wanted you to have.

7687
12:45:14,217 --> 12:45:15,616
What's this?

7688
12:45:16,886 --> 12:45:18,444
You're gonna need it
if you're gonna make it...

7689
12:45:18,588 --> 12:45:20,749
out of Kamata's place alive.

7690
12:45:24,760 --> 12:45:26,421
Don't you need it?

7691
12:45:28,130 --> 12:45:31,622
No, it's cool.
Look, I'll figure it out.

7692
12:46:41,537 --> 12:46:42,629
Sean.

7693
12:46:47,343 --> 12:46:49,004
You need to leave.

7694
12:46:49,345 --> 12:46:51,472
You came to the wrong place.

7695
12:46:51,647 --> 12:46:53,877
I didn't come here to see you.

7696
12:46:54,283 --> 12:46:55,511
Takashi.

7697
12:47:24,146 --> 12:47:25,408
You think...

7698
12:47:26,482 --> 12:47:31,010
you can walk in here,
dump some cash and walk out?

7699
12:47:33,155 --> 12:47:35,055
I know I'm only returning
what belonged to you...

7700
12:47:35,124 --> 12:47:37,092
in the first place, sir.

7701
12:47:38,694 --> 12:47:40,889
But that's not why I really came.

7702
12:47:41,597 --> 12:47:43,588
I came here to apologize.

7703
12:47:45,835 --> 12:47:49,464
I know your nephew and I have
embarrassed ourselves badly.

7704
12:48:01,450 --> 12:48:05,216
Sir, I'm here to offer you
a peaceful solution.

7705
12:48:07,857 --> 12:48:10,325
How do you plan
to accomplish that?

7706
12:48:11,761 --> 12:48:12,921
A race.

7707
12:48:18,167 --> 12:48:21,068
DK and I have caused
nothing but problems for you,

7708
12:48:21,270 --> 12:48:22,737
for us.

7709
12:48:24,040 --> 12:48:26,338
And I'm asking you
to allow us to settle this,

7710
12:48:26,409 --> 12:48:28,434
once and for all.

7711
12:48:29,845 --> 12:48:31,039
We race...

7712
12:48:32,815 --> 12:48:34,908
and the loser leaves town
for good.

7713
12:48:34,984 --> 12:48:37,817
I've already beat
this piece of shit once!

7714
12:48:37,987 --> 12:48:39,079
Good.

7715
12:48:40,056 --> 12:48:42,490
Then it should be easy.

7716
12:49:20,730 --> 12:49:22,823
The cops took all the cars.

7717
12:49:23,332 --> 12:49:24,390
Hey!

7718
12:50:41,210 --> 12:50:42,905
That's why she's spitting.

7719
12:51:06,068 --> 12:51:07,763
We almost there, Twink.

7720
12:51:07,903 --> 12:51:09,598
Couple more tweaks.

7721
12:51:11,140 --> 12:51:13,506
It's not the car
I'm worried about, man.

7722
12:51:14,910 --> 12:51:16,878
DK picked this road
for a reason.

7723
12:51:17,279 --> 12:51:18,974
This is his mountain.

7724
12:51:20,916 --> 12:51:24,010
He's the only one to ever
make it to the bottom.

7725
12:51:35,200 --> 12:51:36,406
Shattered his collarbone,

7726
12:51:36,480 --> 12:51:38,767
fractured his leg in two places.

7727
12:51:38,840 --> 12:51:40,569
He only regained
consciousness this morning.

7728
12:51:40,720 --> 12:51:44,008
The first thing he said was,
"Get me Dom."

7729
12:51:47,480 --> 12:51:48,481
He's in there.

7730
12:51:59,040 --> 12:52:00,565
Are you okay?

7731
12:52:02,200 --> 12:52:04,043
I'm fine.

7732
12:52:04,680 --> 12:52:06,569
He's waiting. Let's go.

7733
12:52:16,880 --> 12:52:18,882
Got something for you.

7734
12:52:21,680 --> 12:52:22,806
Your files.

7735
12:52:22,880 --> 12:52:24,211
Thank you.

7736
12:52:25,720 --> 12:52:27,449
You risk life and limb

7737
12:52:27,520 --> 12:52:29,010
to save the free world
and what do they give you?

7738
12:52:29,160 --> 12:52:32,607
Jell-O and a bad
'70s TV show.

7739
12:52:36,480 --> 12:52:37,720
You know, it's got its perks.

7740
12:52:37,800 --> 12:52:39,723
Sponge baths
ain't that bad.
Dad!

7741
12:52:39,800 --> 12:52:41,086
I'm sorry, baby.

7742
12:52:41,160 --> 12:52:43,003
"Dad?"

7743
12:52:43,280 --> 12:52:46,011
Honey, I want to introduce you
to somebody. He's a, uh...

7744
12:52:47,600 --> 12:52:48,840
He's an old friend.

7745
12:52:48,920 --> 12:52:50,160
Go on and say hello.

7746
12:52:50,240 --> 12:52:51,890
Dominic Toretto, right?

7747
12:52:52,200 --> 12:52:55,204
My dad said he
kicked your ass once.

7748
12:52:55,280 --> 12:52:57,408
Young lady, watch your mouth.

7749
12:53:00,080 --> 12:53:02,367
Your dad's on heavy pain meds.

7750
12:53:03,200 --> 12:53:05,601
I can understand
if his history
is a little hazy.

7751
12:53:05,680 --> 12:53:07,648
- I doubt it.
-Alright, honey, that's enough.

7752
12:53:07,720 --> 12:53:09,722
I want you to go get
something to eat with Elena

7753
12:53:09,800 --> 12:53:11,529
while me and Toretto
have a talk. You hear me?

7754
12:53:11,600 --> 12:53:13,364
Come on, lady.
Let's get some cookies.

7755
12:53:13,440 --> 12:53:15,090
Watch that mouth.

7756
12:53:18,480 --> 12:53:20,164
Who did this?

7757
12:53:21,320 --> 12:53:23,288
You remember Owen Shaw?

7758
12:53:24,600 --> 12:53:26,841
The one we tore
half of London down
trying to get.

7759
12:53:26,960 --> 12:53:29,645
Well, this is his
big bad brother.

7760
12:53:29,920 --> 12:53:31,604
Take a look at this.

7761
12:53:38,120 --> 12:53:39,531
Deckard Shaw.

7762
12:53:39,640 --> 12:53:41,768
British Special Forces assassin.

7763
12:53:41,840 --> 12:53:43,649
The kind of unique asset

7764
12:53:43,720 --> 12:53:45,961
that no government
would ever admit
to employing.

7765
12:53:46,120 --> 12:53:47,246
Black Ops boys.

7766
12:53:47,320 --> 12:53:49,687
Worse.
They created a monster.

7767
12:53:50,840 --> 12:53:53,002
They felt Shaw
was a necessary evil

7768
12:53:53,080 --> 12:53:55,003
until eventually

7769
12:53:55,080 --> 12:53:57,526
they decided he was unnecessary.

7770
12:53:58,760 --> 12:53:59,886
The powers that be

7771
12:53:59,960 --> 12:54:02,088
felt that he knew
just a little bit too much.

7772
12:54:02,160 --> 12:54:03,924
The asset became a liability.

7773
12:54:04,040 --> 12:54:07,010
So they sent in 20 elite
operatives to retire him.

7774
12:54:07,360 --> 12:54:08,600
And they missed.

7775
12:54:08,680 --> 12:54:09,727
That was six years ago,

7776
12:54:09,800 --> 12:54:11,404
and Shaw's been
a ghost ever since.

7777
12:54:11,480 --> 12:54:12,561
Until now.

7778
12:54:14,840 --> 12:54:16,604
How do I find him?

7779
12:54:17,000 --> 12:54:19,526
The official answer
is, you don't.

7780
12:54:22,520 --> 12:54:24,329
He killed Han.

7781
12:54:25,000 --> 12:54:26,240
Almost killed my family.

7782
12:54:26,320 --> 12:54:28,527
He also tried to put me
in a body bag, too.

7783
12:54:28,680 --> 12:54:31,286
Which is why when I get out,
I'm gonna put a hurt
on him so bad

7784
12:54:31,400 --> 12:54:34,290
he's gonna wish
his mama had kept
her legs closed.

7785
12:54:34,360 --> 12:54:36,806
But until then,
my official answer to you

7786
12:54:37,400 --> 12:54:38,606
is stand down.

7787
12:54:38,840 --> 12:54:40,922
Now, you know I can't do that.

7788
12:54:41,000 --> 12:54:42,206
I do know you, Dom.

7789
12:54:42,280 --> 12:54:44,487
Which is why now I give you

7790
12:54:44,560 --> 12:54:46,449
the brother-to-brother answer.

7791
12:54:46,520 --> 12:54:49,603
You do whatever
it is you gotta do.

7792
12:54:49,680 --> 12:54:51,728
When you find that sumbitch,

7793
12:54:52,040 --> 12:54:53,610
just do me one favor.

7794
12:54:53,680 --> 12:54:55,364
What's that?

7795
12:54:56,760 --> 12:54:58,888
Don't miss.

7796
12:55:07,040 --> 12:55:09,008
Thank you so much
for letting us stay, Mando.

7797
12:55:09,080 --> 12:55:10,286
I hope it's not a problem.

7798
12:55:10,360 --> 12:55:13,523
Listen,
Dom needed a safe delivered
to Rio in two days.

7799
12:55:13,600 --> 12:55:14,601
That was a problem.

7800
12:55:14,680 --> 12:55:16,728
Hosting his family
in the Dominican Republic,

7801
12:55:16,800 --> 12:55:17,961
that is vacation.

7802
12:55:18,040 --> 12:55:19,530
Anyone messes with you here,

7803
12:55:19,680 --> 12:55:21,489
they mess with
the entire country.

7804
12:55:21,560 --> 12:55:22,846
You'll be safe.

7805
12:55:31,280 --> 12:55:34,568
Yeah, yeah, they're here.
I picked them up
myself at the airport.

7806
12:55:34,640 --> 12:55:36,324
Hold on. Your brother.

7807
12:55:36,400 --> 12:55:37,401
Dom.

7808
12:55:37,920 --> 12:55:39,081
Yeah, Mia, it's me.

7809
12:55:39,160 --> 12:55:40,161
<i>How's it going there?</i>

7810
12:55:40,240 --> 12:55:41,571
We're at Mando's.

7811
12:55:41,680 --> 12:55:43,091
This place is like a fortress.

7812
12:55:43,160 --> 12:55:46,369
You should see Brian.
He's in full FBI mode.

7813
12:55:46,440 --> 12:55:49,683
He built a surveillance hub
in Mando's garage
and everything.

7814
12:55:50,400 --> 12:55:52,482
<i>What about you?
Did you find out
who's after us?</i>

7815
12:55:52,560 --> 12:55:55,370
Looks like the sins of London
have followed us home.

7816
12:55:55,440 --> 12:55:57,044
<i>How did Buster take the news?</i>

7817
12:55:57,120 --> 12:55:58,531
I can't tell him.

7818
12:55:58,600 --> 12:56:00,602
If he knew about the baby,
he'd stay here with us.

7819
12:56:00,680 --> 12:56:03,763
<i>And with all that's
going on, you're gonna
need him by your side.</i>

7820
12:56:03,840 --> 12:56:06,844
Just watch out for
him. Keep him safe.

7821
12:56:06,920 --> 12:56:07,921
And come home together.

7822
12:56:08,160 --> 12:56:11,881
Tell Brian I'll see him
in LA in two days.

7823
12:56:12,240 --> 12:56:13,287
Where are you going?

7824
12:56:13,440 --> 12:56:14,885
Tokyo.

7825
12:56:15,320 --> 12:56:17,402
I'm bringing Han home.

7826
12:56:18,600 --> 12:56:20,648
<i>Authorities are still
trying to determine</i>

7827
12:56:20,760 --> 12:56:23,366
<i>the motive behind
this daring attack
here at the office</i>

7828
12:56:23,440 --> 12:56:26,922
<i>of the US Diplomatic
Security Service in
downtown Los Angeles</i>

7829
12:56:27,000 --> 12:56:29,765
<i>less than 36 hours ago.</i>

7830
12:56:29,840 --> 12:56:30,921
<i>Facts are still coming in,</i>

7831
12:56:31,000 --> 12:56:33,162
<i>but what is known
is the suspect entered</i>

7832
12:56:33,240 --> 12:56:35,891
<i>the building's fourth floor...</i>

7833
12:56:35,960 --> 12:56:37,291
Hey-

7834
12:56:37,880 --> 12:56:39,803
You okay?
Yeah.

7835
12:56:40,000 --> 12:56:43,322
This guy's just relentless.

7836
12:56:44,840 --> 12:56:47,002
That's why Dom needs you.

7837
12:56:47,200 --> 12:56:50,124
You two need to find
this guy and you
need to stop him

7838
12:56:50,200 --> 12:56:52,965
before he does
any more damage
to our family.

7839
12:56:54,640 --> 12:56:56,369
You know, I just...

7840
12:56:57,680 --> 12:56:59,887
I've screwed up so many things.

7841
12:57:00,520 --> 12:57:03,603
I couldn't live with myself
if I screw this up, too.

7842
12:57:04,160 --> 12:57:05,161
You won't.

7843
12:57:06,480 --> 12:57:08,323
I believe in you.

7844
12:57:08,480 --> 12:57:11,689
I believe in us.
That's all that matters.

7845
12:57:12,840 --> 12:57:14,729
I love you, Brian.

7846
12:57:24,640 --> 12:57:25,846
I love you, baby.

7847
12:57:27,520 --> 12:57:31,127
Just promise me,
after this, we're done.

7848
12:57:31,200 --> 12:57:34,124
No more jobs, no more enemies.

7849
12:57:34,200 --> 12:57:35,884
Come back to us.

7850
12:57:36,000 --> 12:57:37,809
I won't let you down, Mia.

7851
12:57:39,480 --> 12:57:40,641
I know.

7852
13:01:38,400 --> 13:01:39,560
Yeah!

7853
13:01:46,475 --> 13:01:47,567
Yeah!

7854
13:01:47,643 --> 13:01:48,735
Yes!

7855
13:02:19,600 --> 13:02:20,624
Come on.

7856
13:02:59,214 --> 13:03:00,476
Yeah! Come on!

7857
13:03:00,549 --> 13:03:01,777
Come on, Sean.

7858
13:03:01,917 --> 13:03:03,179
Let's go! Let's go!

7859
13:03:03,252 --> 13:03:05,152
Sean, you the boss. Let's go.

7860
13:03:33,315 --> 13:03:35,579
Damn! Come on, man!
That ain't right.

7861
13:05:45,647 --> 13:05:46,636
Yeah, baby!

7862
13:05:46,715 --> 13:05:47,875
That's what
I'm talking about, man.

7863
13:05:47,950 --> 13:05:49,315
I told you!

7864
13:06:53,916 --> 13:06:56,009
Hey, yo, Sean! Yo, Sean!

7865
13:06:56,718 --> 13:06:58,413
Hey, check this out, man.

7866
13:06:58,720 --> 13:07:01,553
This dude over here
wanna race the new DK.

7867
13:07:02,524 --> 13:07:05,357
Heard he's been beating
everybody around Asia, too.

7868
13:07:05,427 --> 13:07:07,258
Not tonight, Twinkie.

7869
13:07:10,732 --> 13:07:12,359
Said he knew Han.

7870
13:07:18,974 --> 13:07:20,737
Said Han was family.

7871
13:07:34,756 --> 13:07:36,087
All right.

7872
13:07:36,491 --> 13:07:37,583
Let's race.

7873
13:08:04,820 --> 13:08:06,151
Nice ride.

7874
13:08:06,622 --> 13:08:09,614
I won it from my friend Han,
a few years ago.

7875
13:08:11,693 --> 13:08:14,389
I didn't know he was
into American muscle.

7876
13:08:14,463 --> 13:08:16,954
He was when
he was rolling with me.

7877
13:08:19,568 --> 13:08:22,036
You know this ain't
no 10-second race.

7878
13:08:22,504 --> 13:08:24,404
I got nothing but time.

7879
13:08:28,010 --> 13:08:29,534
You ready, kid?

7880
13:08:40,422 --> 13:08:42,083
Come on, Sean! Come on!

7881
13:08:44,126 --> 13:08:45,286
Ready!

7882
13:08:48,397 --> 13:08:49,455
Set!

7883
13:08:53,769 --> 13:08:54,929
Go!

7884
13:08:56,300 --> 13:09:00,271
Han said you was fast,
but not that damn fast.

7885
13:09:01,220 --> 13:09:03,587
Who said American
muscle can't drift?

7886
13:09:05,100 --> 13:09:08,582
Han mentioned he left his
enemies in his rearview.

7887
13:09:09,260 --> 13:09:12,070
He never talked about it much.

7888
13:09:12,420 --> 13:09:15,105
Always playing it
close to the vest.

7889
13:09:19,940 --> 13:09:23,149
We found a couple
things by the crash.

7890
13:09:23,780 --> 13:09:24,986
Wasn't much left.

7891
13:09:32,980 --> 13:09:34,141
Gisele.

7892
13:09:38,140 --> 13:09:39,744
Oh, yeah.

7893
13:09:40,100 --> 13:09:41,784
There's one more thing.

7894
13:09:44,460 --> 13:09:46,622
I found this.

7895
13:09:49,380 --> 13:09:51,781
Must have meant
something to him.

7896
13:09:52,260 --> 13:09:54,262
When you find the guy
that killed Han,

7897
13:09:55,820 --> 13:09:57,151
what are you going to do?

7898
13:09:58,940 --> 13:10:02,023
Words ain't even
been invented yet.

7899
13:10:23,500 --> 13:10:26,947
They say to live
in the hearts of those
we leave behind

7900
13:10:27,540 --> 13:10:29,542
is not to die.

7901
13:10:29,780 --> 13:10:32,226
But he put you in this grave.

7902
13:10:34,460 --> 13:10:36,861
So now I'll do the same to him.

7903
13:10:41,500 --> 13:10:44,026
I can't do no more funerals.

7904
13:10:44,620 --> 13:10:45,621
First Han.

7905
13:10:48,540 --> 13:10:51,111
Now Hobbs is laid up,
of all people.

7906
13:10:56,700 --> 13:10:58,225
We're being hunted.

7907
13:11:04,660 --> 13:11:07,186
You know he's out there
somewhere watching, right?

7908
13:11:07,860 --> 13:11:09,066
I hope so.

7909
13:11:09,540 --> 13:11:11,030
Means he's close.

7910
13:11:12,420 --> 13:11:14,548
Just promise me, Brian,

7911
13:11:15,060 --> 13:11:16,630
no more funerals.

7912
13:11:17,060 --> 13:11:18,266
Just one more.

7913
13:11:22,260 --> 13:11:23,307
His.

7914
13:14:09,740 --> 13:14:11,902
You never should have
messed with a man's family.

7915
13:14:12,060 --> 13:14:13,664
I told your brother
the same thing.

7916
13:14:17,580 --> 13:14:18,991
Reinforced your chassis.

7917
13:14:19,980 --> 13:14:22,221
It's like going into a ring
with weighted gloves.

7918
13:14:22,300 --> 13:14:23,540
Your mistake.

7919
13:14:24,180 --> 13:14:25,705
I'm not here to play games.

7920
13:14:26,540 --> 13:14:30,022
See, you and me,
we're from
different worlds.

7921
13:14:30,900 --> 13:14:33,870
Trust me, I've seen a lot
meaner streets than
the ones you're used to.

7922
13:14:34,260 --> 13:14:35,341
Stick around.

7923
13:14:37,100 --> 13:14:38,740
It's gonna get a lot meaner.

7924
13:14:41,380 --> 13:14:43,382
You thought this was
gonna be a street fight?

7925
13:15:02,540 --> 13:15:03,985
On the ground.

7926
13:15:04,540 --> 13:15:05,541
Now!

7927
13:15:07,860 --> 13:15:09,350
Drop him
or I will drop you!

7928
13:15:10,740 --> 13:15:13,710
Whoa, whoa. Easy, guys.
We're on the same team here.

7929
13:15:14,980 --> 13:15:16,220
Mr. Toretto,

7930
13:15:16,380 --> 13:15:19,350
I'm here
on the recommendation
of a mutual friend of ours.

7931
13:15:19,420 --> 13:15:21,184
Mr. Hobbs.
Who the hell are you?

7932
13:15:21,260 --> 13:15:22,989
Me? I'm just a guy.

7933
13:15:23,060 --> 13:15:24,824
I'm Mr. Nobody.

7934
13:15:25,540 --> 13:15:27,702
It's a big entrance
for a nobody.

7935
13:15:28,060 --> 13:15:31,542
And the guy that put
our mutual friend
in the hospital?

7936
13:15:31,740 --> 13:15:32,780
You just let him get away.

7937
13:15:33,100 --> 13:15:36,547
I think I might
have just saved
your ass there, Dom.

7938
13:15:36,660 --> 13:15:38,901
Listen, you think
you could let go
of my guy there?

7939
13:15:38,980 --> 13:15:41,301
He's beginning to
turn a little blue.

7940
13:15:43,620 --> 13:15:45,460
I appreciate that.

7941
13:15:46,180 --> 13:15:47,705
Ah, here they come.

7942
13:15:47,780 --> 13:15:48,781
Listen, Dom.

7943
13:15:49,020 --> 13:15:53,821
There's a war going
on between shadows
and ghosts like me.

7944
13:15:55,300 --> 13:15:58,224
You and your team
unwittingly walked into
the middle of it in London,

7945
13:15:58,300 --> 13:16:00,667
and it appears it's
now followed you home.

7946
13:16:03,460 --> 13:16:04,985
It's up to you.

7947
13:16:05,700 --> 13:16:06,747
I'm gonna have a beer.

7948
13:16:07,460 --> 13:16:08,871
You're welcome to join me.

7949
13:16:08,940 --> 13:16:11,784
By the way, I can
get you Deckard Shaw.

7950
13:16:24,580 --> 13:16:25,945
Belgian ale.

7951
13:16:28,820 --> 13:16:31,391
Oh, man, those
monks got it right.

7952
13:16:31,460 --> 13:16:33,383
I mean, I don't know
about the whole
celibacy thing,

7953
13:16:33,460 --> 13:16:35,462
but when it comes to beer...

7954
13:16:36,380 --> 13:16:37,381
Would you like one?

7955
13:16:38,180 --> 13:16:39,784
I'm more of a Corona man myself.

7956
13:16:39,940 --> 13:16:40,941
Ah.

7957
13:16:43,660 --> 13:16:47,506
Your file's not only detailed,

7958
13:16:47,660 --> 13:16:50,948
it's, uh,
extremely entertaining.

7959
13:16:56,700 --> 13:16:59,909
Look, Shaw's power
is that he's a shadow.

7960
13:16:59,980 --> 13:17:03,063
He's really good
at getting in and out of
places without being seen

7961
13:17:03,140 --> 13:17:05,222
and leaving
nothing but a body count
in his wake.

7962
13:17:05,300 --> 13:17:08,827
I mean, he's a legitimate
English badass.

7963
13:17:08,980 --> 13:17:10,823
But to be honest
with you, Dom,
I don't give two shits

7964
13:17:10,900 --> 13:17:12,584
about Deckard Shaw.

7965
13:17:12,660 --> 13:17:14,025
It's you I want.

7966
13:17:14,100 --> 13:17:18,150
Because you and I
can help each other
get what we both need.

7967
13:17:19,460 --> 13:17:20,791
I'm listening.

7968
13:17:20,860 --> 13:17:23,431
Just recently a private
military company

7969
13:17:23,500 --> 13:17:26,390
led by a wanted terrorist
named Mose Jakande

7970
13:17:26,460 --> 13:17:28,986
kidnapped a hacker
known only by
the name "Ramsey."

7971
13:17:29,060 --> 13:17:30,141
Now, Lady Liberty's
got her panties

7972
13:17:30,220 --> 13:17:31,949
in a bunch over this,
but rightfully so,

7973
13:17:32,020 --> 13:17:34,910
because this Ramsey
has created
something interesting.

7974
13:17:35,340 --> 13:17:36,865
- Bring it up.
- Yes, sir.

7975
13:17:37,140 --> 13:17:38,630
Say hello

7976
13:17:38,860 --> 13:17:40,191
to God's Eye.

7977
13:17:40,340 --> 13:17:43,105
Now, this little bastard
hacks into anything that's
on the digital network.

7978
13:17:43,180 --> 13:17:46,866
That means every
cell phone, satellite,
ATM machine and computer.

7979
13:17:47,100 --> 13:17:48,147
Simultaneously.

7980
13:17:48,220 --> 13:17:50,029
If it's got
a microphone or a lens,

7981
13:17:50,100 --> 13:17:51,829
God's Eye can find you.

7982
13:17:51,900 --> 13:17:54,346
So you invited me
here to show me
a tracking device.

7983
13:17:54,420 --> 13:17:56,468
On steroids. Lots of them.

7984
13:17:56,540 --> 13:17:58,144
Let me put it to you this way.

7985
13:17:58,260 --> 13:18:00,831
It took us nearly
a decade to find
Osama bin Laden.

7986
13:18:00,900 --> 13:18:03,267
With this,
we'd have located him
anywhere on the planet

7987
13:18:03,740 --> 13:18:04,901
in a couple of hours.

7988
13:18:04,980 --> 13:18:07,506
Now, that's a serious
piece of machinery

7989
13:18:07,580 --> 13:18:09,503
that could be catastrophic
in the wrong hands.

7990
13:18:09,860 --> 13:18:11,988
But for some very nauseating
political reasons,

7991
13:18:12,060 --> 13:18:13,346
any rescue plans involving

7992
13:18:13,420 --> 13:18:16,310
any US government
forces or entity

7993
13:18:16,380 --> 13:18:18,348
has been strictly ruled out.

7994
13:18:19,780 --> 13:18:21,464
And that's why I need you.

7995
13:18:22,060 --> 13:18:24,222
But why do I need you?

7996
13:18:24,500 --> 13:18:26,582
I mean, I could go back outside,

7997
13:18:26,660 --> 13:18:28,628
enjoy the rest of the Coronas,

7998
13:18:29,020 --> 13:18:30,749
let Shaw come to me.

7999
13:18:30,900 --> 13:18:33,551
You could do that.
How's that working out
for you so far?

8000
13:18:33,700 --> 13:18:34,667
You got one friend
in the ground,

8001
13:18:34,740 --> 13:18:35,980
another one in the hospital.

8002
13:18:36,060 --> 13:18:38,381
And then, of course,
there's that little
issue of the bomb

8003
13:18:38,460 --> 13:18:40,588
that destroyed your home.

8004
13:18:40,940 --> 13:18:42,590
Shaw lives in a
world that doesn't

8005
13:18:42,660 --> 13:18:44,583
play by your rules.

8006
13:18:45,380 --> 13:18:46,381
Like it or not,

8007
13:18:46,540 --> 13:18:48,861
you live in that world now, too.

8008
13:18:49,900 --> 13:18:51,868
You wanna know
how to kill a shadow?

8009
13:18:52,060 --> 13:18:54,267
You just shine
a little light on it.

8010
13:18:54,420 --> 13:18:56,024
If you get the God's Eye for me,

8011
13:18:56,100 --> 13:18:57,704
I've already got authorization

8012
13:18:57,820 --> 13:19:00,027
for you to use it
until you get Shaw.

8013
13:19:00,100 --> 13:19:02,068
You go from the hunted
to the hunter.

8014
13:19:02,140 --> 13:19:04,461
And there's
no place on Earth
Shaw can hide from you.

8015
13:19:04,780 --> 13:19:06,384
More importantly,

8016
13:19:06,540 --> 13:19:12,263
you and your family
don't go to
any more funerals.

8017
13:19:13,460 --> 13:19:15,906
You get Ramsey,
you get the God's Eye,

8018
13:19:16,140 --> 13:19:17,346
you get Shaw.

8019
13:19:18,740 --> 13:19:21,186
Well, that's the wind-up
and the pitch.

8020
13:19:22,340 --> 13:19:24,581
Now that I've given you
this incredibly sensitive

8021
13:19:24,660 --> 13:19:27,106
and highly
classified information,

8022
13:19:27,620 --> 13:19:28,700
what do you think, Toretto?

8023
13:19:29,300 --> 13:19:31,143
I think you already know
what I'm gonna do.

8024
13:19:31,500 --> 13:19:32,740
Good.

8025
13:19:32,900 --> 13:19:35,631
But it'll be my way.

8026
13:19:36,500 --> 13:19:37,501
And my crew.

8027
13:19:37,580 --> 13:19:39,628
I assumed you might say that.

8028
13:19:39,980 --> 13:19:43,427
Which is why
I've taken the liberty
of gathering your team.

8029
13:19:56,020 --> 13:19:58,022
This is crazy.

8030
13:19:58,180 --> 13:20:00,945
What the hell is
going on in here?

8031
13:20:02,980 --> 13:20:04,900
Our intelligence
suggests that Ramsey

8032
13:20:04,940 --> 13:20:06,749
will be transported
by an armed motorcade

8033
13:20:06,820 --> 13:20:08,584
through the Caucasus
mountain range.

8034
13:20:08,660 --> 13:20:10,788
If they clear this range
and reach their destination,

8035
13:20:10,860 --> 13:20:12,589
Ramsey is as good as gone.

8036
13:20:12,660 --> 13:20:13,786
So let me
get this straight.

8037
13:20:13,860 --> 13:20:16,431
There's only one road
that leads in or out,

8038
13:20:16,500 --> 13:20:18,548
sheer drops on every side,

8039
13:20:18,620 --> 13:20:21,271
a motorcade from hell
protected by a small army

8040
13:20:21,340 --> 13:20:22,865
from one mile in
either direction?

8041
13:20:23,500 --> 13:20:25,502
Yeah, that's about it.

8042
13:20:26,340 --> 13:20:27,705
You done?
No, I'm not done.

8043
13:20:28,340 --> 13:20:29,910
So you all wanted me
to break into

8044
13:20:29,980 --> 13:20:31,584
a police station. Fine.

8045
13:20:32,140 --> 13:20:33,710
Then you asked me
to stop a tank.

8046
13:20:33,860 --> 13:20:35,624
I wasn't happy about it,
but I did it.

8047
13:20:35,860 --> 13:20:37,862
Then you came up with
this brilliant idea

8048
13:20:37,940 --> 13:20:41,387
to shoot down
one of the largest
airplanes ever.

8049
13:20:41,460 --> 13:20:44,031
I shot that shit
out of the sky. Mmm.

8050
13:20:44,540 --> 13:20:45,541
It's nothing.

8051
13:20:46,540 --> 13:20:47,905
But this right here, my friend,

8052
13:20:48,060 --> 13:20:49,266
happens to be

8053
13:20:49,340 --> 13:20:52,708
the stupidest idea
I've ever heard of
in my life.

8054
13:20:52,780 --> 13:20:54,908
I forgot that you
were the only one
to bring the plane down.

8055
13:20:55,020 --> 13:20:57,140
No, no. The only thing
I've ever seen him
take down was

8056
13:20:57,180 --> 13:20:58,341
"No Knees" Denise.

8057
13:20:58,420 --> 13:21:00,229
Remember, at prom?

8058
13:21:00,300 --> 13:21:02,348
Really, Brian?
You're gonna do
that right here?

8059
13:21:02,540 --> 13:21:04,986
See, y'all trying to
get me off my point.

8060
13:21:05,060 --> 13:21:08,189
All I'm saying is,
I'm tired of
everybody around me

8061
13:21:08,260 --> 13:21:10,342
making all the decisions.

8062
13:21:10,420 --> 13:21:11,910
This time, I lead.

8063
13:21:11,980 --> 13:21:15,223
Seriously. If I don't
start making decisions,
I'm out.

8064
13:21:15,300 --> 13:21:17,064
All right, Roman.

8065
13:21:17,660 --> 13:21:18,786
What do you got?

8066
13:21:20,580 --> 13:21:24,665
I mean, I wasn't
trying to get into the whole
leadership thing, like, now.

8067
13:21:24,740 --> 13:21:26,105
You know what I'm saying?

8068
13:21:26,180 --> 13:21:28,340
I was just, kind of,
talking about,
like, at some point.

8069
13:21:28,380 --> 13:21:29,506
Like, you know, when we...

8070
13:21:29,740 --> 13:21:31,469
Whatever. I mean, I think...

8071
13:21:34,380 --> 13:21:35,506
Let's hit it from here.

8072
13:21:35,580 --> 13:21:37,821
I don't think
that that's...
No, no, no, don't think.

8073
13:21:37,900 --> 13:21:39,789
That's my job.

8074
13:21:42,220 --> 13:21:43,221
Okay-

8075
13:21:43,900 --> 13:21:47,188
It is impossible
to hit it there.

8076
13:21:47,260 --> 13:21:50,503
That is literally
the most secure spot
on the mountain.

8077
13:21:50,580 --> 13:21:53,026
Why? Because you cannot
physically access it.

8078
13:21:53,300 --> 13:21:55,348
See, that's what
makes it so sweet.

8079
13:21:55,420 --> 13:21:58,026
Because it's the place
that they least expect us
to hit them from.

8080
13:21:58,100 --> 13:21:59,750
As much as I hate to admit it,

8081
13:21:59,820 --> 13:22:00,860
he's onto something there.

8082
13:22:01,180 --> 13:22:02,306
What do you think, Dom?

8083
13:22:03,580 --> 13:22:05,105
- Here?
- Yeah.

8084
13:22:06,940 --> 13:22:08,146
I think we got a plan.

8085
13:22:08,260 --> 13:22:11,025
Completely wrong thinking.

8086
13:22:11,100 --> 13:22:12,147
And I like it.

8087
13:22:12,780 --> 13:22:14,942
You see? I'm good at this.

8088
13:22:15,460 --> 13:22:17,622
"Good?" Okay.

8089
13:22:18,220 --> 13:22:20,340
How are you
planning on getting
on that road?

8090
13:22:21,180 --> 13:22:22,989
Well, Tej?

8091
13:22:25,180 --> 13:22:27,581
I think I may actually
have a plan for that.

8092
13:22:28,140 --> 13:22:32,828
What? I delegated.
That's what good leaders do.

8093
13:22:32,980 --> 13:22:34,141
Leader

8094
13:22:34,300 --> 13:22:36,268
You know, when I was
reading your files,

8095
13:22:36,340 --> 13:22:38,581
I was impressed with
what you've accomplished
with your team.

8096
13:22:38,660 --> 13:22:42,301
But meeting them now,
I've gotta say, Dom,

8097
13:22:42,980 --> 13:22:44,744
you've truly got a gift.

8098
13:22:47,700 --> 13:22:51,307
Consider my workshop
your new playhouse.

8099
13:22:51,380 --> 13:22:55,510
I think you'll find our
cars extremely appealing.

8100
13:22:56,140 --> 13:22:59,349
And your team is now complete.

8101
13:23:10,220 --> 13:23:11,984
I went to the house.

8102
13:23:12,860 --> 13:23:14,862
I was looking
for you everywhere.

8103
13:23:16,180 --> 13:23:18,262
You scared the shit out of me.

8104
13:23:22,620 --> 13:23:24,702
<i>You will
never be alone.
Wherever you go...</i>

8105
13:23:24,780 --> 13:23:26,544
<i>Tell no one.</i>

8106
13:23:27,180 --> 13:23:28,989
Where did you find that?

8107
13:23:31,980 --> 13:23:33,220
Found in Han's car.

8108
13:23:33,820 --> 13:23:35,265
It was left as a message.

8109
13:23:35,420 --> 13:23:38,230
A message I plan on returning.

8110
13:23:39,500 --> 13:23:40,786
Can you ride?

8111
13:23:40,860 --> 13:23:42,510
Yeah, of course I can.

8112
13:23:42,580 --> 13:23:44,867
Han was my family, too.

8113
13:23:48,860 --> 13:23:50,271
Brian!

8114
13:23:50,340 --> 13:23:52,502
We're gonna need
long-travel suspension,

8115
13:23:52,580 --> 13:23:54,628
limited-slip differentials
on all of them.

8116
13:23:54,740 --> 13:23:55,901
How you doing?

8117
13:23:56,580 --> 13:23:57,661
Tej!

8118
13:23:57,740 --> 13:24:01,028
I want the demon
love child between that

8119
13:24:02,060 --> 13:24:03,550
and that.

8120
13:24:04,620 --> 13:24:06,065
That's a lot of armor.

8121
13:24:06,140 --> 13:24:07,710
It's just gonna add more weight.

8122
13:24:07,780 --> 13:24:09,191
Slow you down.

8123
13:24:11,060 --> 13:24:13,540
This time, it ain't
just about being fast.

8124
13:24:20,780 --> 13:24:22,305
Yeah, I'm good.

8125
13:24:24,580 --> 13:24:26,660
From the streets.
You know what I'm saying?

8126
13:24:27,260 --> 13:24:28,307
It's nothing.

8127
13:24:34,260 --> 13:24:36,627
Hey, Roman,
you're freaking out,
ain't you?

8128
13:24:36,740 --> 13:24:38,151
No.
Yeah, you are.

8129
13:24:38,500 --> 13:24:39,547
I said no.

8130
13:24:40,060 --> 13:24:43,143
Listen, man,
it takes a grown man
to embrace his feelings.

8131
13:24:43,580 --> 13:24:45,787
<i>If you need to cry,
just go ahead and cry.</i>

8132
13:24:46,620 --> 13:24:49,385
As your friend,
you know I'm concerned
about your well-being,

8133
13:24:49,460 --> 13:24:50,791
<i>which is why I took
the precaution</i>

8134
13:24:50,940 --> 13:24:53,705
of putting some adult diapers
in your glove compartment.

8135
13:24:53,780 --> 13:24:55,060
Yo, can you just chill out, man?

8136
13:24:55,660 --> 13:24:57,549
<i>I have seen
some crazy shit, Dom,</i>

8137
13:24:57,620 --> 13:24:59,304
but this really
could make some waves.

8138
13:24:59,460 --> 13:25:03,101
So let's just try to keep it
as low-key as possible, huh?

8139
13:25:03,180 --> 13:25:04,341
Don't I always?

8140
13:25:04,420 --> 13:25:08,027
<i>I'll tell you what,
you knock it down
a couple of notches this time</i>

8141
13:25:08,100 --> 13:25:11,070
and I'll swap out my Belgian
for a keg of Corona.

8142
13:25:11,620 --> 13:25:13,622
You'd be doing
yourself a favor, there.

8143
13:25:14,340 --> 13:25:16,581
Can somebody just walk me
through what we're
supposed to be doing?

8144
13:25:16,660 --> 13:25:19,106
Come on,
Rome, this is your plan.
You gotta embrace it.

8145
13:25:19,180 --> 13:25:20,625
No, this was not my plan.

8146
13:25:24,540 --> 13:25:25,780
Oh, yeah, here we go.
Game time.

8147
13:25:39,620 --> 13:25:41,349
<i>Roman,
you need some fresh air?</i>

8148
13:25:41,420 --> 13:25:43,220
Because you're about to
get a whole lot of it.

8149
13:25:46,780 --> 13:25:48,828
Okay, here we go!

8150
13:26:06,340 --> 13:26:09,025
Just when you didn't think
it could get any better, huh?

8151
13:26:15,060 --> 13:26:16,550
Oh, shit!

8152
13:26:29,180 --> 13:26:30,181
Whoo!

8153
13:26:31,100 --> 13:26:32,101
Now we're moving.

8154
13:26:39,380 --> 13:26:42,543
Everybody good?
Everybody make it out?

8155
13:26:47,260 --> 13:26:49,422
You just didn't tell them
that this is not for you!

8156
13:26:49,540 --> 13:26:50,826
This is not your mission!

8157
13:26:50,900 --> 13:26:53,221
Hey, Rome? Hey, what's up, man?
Talk to me, come on!

8158
13:26:54,100 --> 13:26:55,989
- I can't <i>do it.</i>
<i>- The hell you can't!</i>

8159
13:26:56,060 --> 13:26:57,550
Come on, man!
You throw that thing

8160
13:26:57,620 --> 13:26:59,304
in reverse and get
your ass out here now!

8161
13:26:59,380 --> 13:27:01,667
Look, I can't do it, okay?
Listen to what I'm saying.

8162
13:27:01,740 --> 13:27:02,821
Now isn't the time!

8163
13:27:02,900 --> 13:27:04,265
<i>I'ma stay up here
with the pilot.</i>

8164
13:27:04,580 --> 13:27:06,184
We gonna circle
around and make sure

8165
13:27:06,260 --> 13:27:07,546
we holding it down from up here!

8166
13:27:07,700 --> 13:27:09,020
You're running
out of time!

8167
13:27:09,140 --> 13:27:11,268
The chute is guided by GPS!

8168
13:27:11,780 --> 13:27:13,509
<i>You don't have to do anything!</i>

8169
13:27:13,580 --> 13:27:15,230
Tej!
I'm already on it.

8170
13:27:15,780 --> 13:27:17,191
<i>Hey, man, listen.</i>

8171
13:27:17,260 --> 13:27:18,705
I'm sorry to
let y'all down, okay?

8172
13:27:18,820 --> 13:27:20,231
I'ma go ahead and stay up here.

8173
13:27:20,300 --> 13:27:21,301
<i>No, brother.</i>

8174
13:27:21,380 --> 13:27:22,905
I'm sorry to
let you down.
What?

8175
13:27:24,780 --> 13:27:25,941
What do you mean you're...

8176
13:27:29,300 --> 13:27:31,302
Tej! What are you doing?

8177
13:27:37,140 --> 13:27:38,949
Oh, shit!

8178
13:27:40,420 --> 13:27:41,467
Tej!

8179
13:27:42,100 --> 13:27:43,784
I hate you, Tej!

8180
13:27:46,940 --> 13:27:47,987
Get ready!

8181
13:27:48,180 --> 13:27:49,466
Ground's coming fast!

8182
13:27:57,300 --> 13:27:59,302
Come on, baby. Come on.

8183
13:28:42,900 --> 13:28:44,106
Oh, yeah!

8184
13:28:47,860 --> 13:28:49,021
Touchdown, baby!

8185
13:28:53,700 --> 13:28:54,940
Car check. Call it in.

8186
13:28:55,100 --> 13:28:56,101
Check.
Check.

8187
13:28:56,180 --> 13:28:57,227
I'm good. Let's do this.

8188
13:29:00,020 --> 13:29:03,547
Hello? Please, man.
Get me out of here, somebody!

8189
13:29:03,940 --> 13:29:05,101
No! The trees!

8190
13:29:05,860 --> 13:29:06,860
Oh, shit.

8191
13:29:06,900 --> 13:29:08,470
Sit tight, Roman.
We'll come back for you.

8192
13:29:08,540 --> 13:29:10,030
This is not the plan!

8193
13:29:30,820 --> 13:29:32,310
All right,
you got one chance
to hit them here, Dom.

8194
13:29:32,820 --> 13:29:34,424
You miss, they'll make
it to their black site

8195
13:29:34,540 --> 13:29:36,827
and they'll squeeze
whatever information
they need out of Ramsey.

8196
13:29:36,900 --> 13:29:39,824
<i>The device and your chance
of ever getting Shaw
will be gone for good.</i>

8197
13:29:39,900 --> 13:29:41,026
That ain't gonna happen.

8198
13:29:41,780 --> 13:29:43,111
I'll see you at the pickup.

8199
13:29:48,140 --> 13:29:49,380
Ramsey will be in the bus.

8200
13:29:49,460 --> 13:29:50,621
Then let's do this.

8201
13:30:00,020 --> 13:30:02,068
Captain, we have company.
Four cars, inbound.

8202
13:30:16,420 --> 13:30:17,421
Oh, shit!

8203
13:30:29,500 --> 13:30:30,865
Tej, shield!
I'm on the way.

8204
13:30:35,780 --> 13:30:36,941
All right, formation.

8205
13:30:43,700 --> 13:30:44,986
Bulletproof, baby.

8206
13:30:45,060 --> 13:30:47,062
<i>Can't touch this</i>

8207
13:30:50,820 --> 13:30:51,821
Punch it!

8208
13:31:16,460 --> 13:31:17,950
Strike! Ha-ha!

8209
13:31:28,180 --> 13:31:29,591
Guns free.

8210
13:31:34,380 --> 13:31:35,381
No!

8211
13:31:40,300 --> 13:31:41,301
Get out of the way!

8212
13:31:54,340 --> 13:31:56,422
Those aren't guns,
those are goddamn cannons!

8213
13:31:56,500 --> 13:31:57,786
Armor-piercing rounds!

8214
13:32:22,140 --> 13:32:23,141
Hook them up.

8215
13:32:29,860 --> 13:32:31,430
Brian, Tej, blow it!

8216
13:32:40,540 --> 13:32:41,701
Lock it up.

8217
13:32:46,780 --> 13:32:47,781
Huh?

8218
13:32:52,300 --> 13:32:54,029
Brian, you're up.

8219
13:33:12,740 --> 13:33:13,901
Little closer, Tej!

8220
13:33:49,220 --> 13:33:50,221
Ramsey?

8221
13:33:50,420 --> 13:33:52,946
Stay away from me!
Stay back!
Don't you touch me!

8222
13:33:53,020 --> 13:33:54,465
My name's Brian.
I'm gonna get you
out of here

8223
13:33:54,540 --> 13:33:56,065
but I'm gonna need you
to settle down, all right?

8224
13:33:56,140 --> 13:33:57,620
I'm gonna cut those
things off of you.

8225
13:34:13,060 --> 13:34:14,061
Sir?

8226
13:34:15,420 --> 13:34:17,701
Sir, we
have an unidentified
vehicle approaching.

8227
13:34:19,500 --> 13:34:20,831
Come on! Closer!

8228
13:34:20,900 --> 13:34:22,345
You're gonna
have to jump.
No! No! No!

8229
13:34:22,420 --> 13:34:23,780
We don't have time!
Come on!

8230
13:34:24,500 --> 13:34:26,229
We gotta get out of here.
Come on.

8231
13:34:26,300 --> 13:34:27,870
Look at me!
Look at me!
I'm not jumping!

8232
13:34:27,940 --> 13:34:30,671
You don’t jump,
we're gonna die. Okay?

8233
13:34:31,460 --> 13:34:32,507
You're jumping. Come on!

8234
13:34:32,580 --> 13:34:33,820
One.

8235
13:34:33,900 --> 13:34:35,231
Two!

8236
13:34:43,580 --> 13:34:45,105
Well, well, well.

8237
13:34:51,300 --> 13:34:52,426
Take my hand!

8238
13:35:08,180 --> 13:35:10,831
Welcome to the
party, Mr. Shaw.

8239
13:35:59,940 --> 13:36:01,749
<i>Letty, stay with Brian.</i>

8240
13:36:26,020 --> 13:36:27,021
Oh, shit!

8241
13:36:31,380 --> 13:36:33,382
What are you doing?
This is crazy!

8242
13:36:33,500 --> 13:36:34,706
Keeping you alive.

8243
13:37:19,940 --> 13:37:22,022
There's a Cliff. Cliff!

8244
13:37:22,540 --> 13:37:23,746
Cliff! There's a Cliff!

8245
13:38:00,580 --> 13:38:01,581
Shit!

8246
13:38:55,500 --> 13:38:56,501
Too slow.

8247
13:39:39,660 --> 13:39:41,469
Yeah!

8248
13:39:43,940 --> 13:39:45,021
I'm back, bitches!

8249
13:41:17,180 --> 13:41:18,181
You good?

8250
13:41:19,100 --> 13:41:20,465
Thank you.

8251
13:41:37,020 --> 13:41:38,863
<i>Roman, get back
to the others.
What about you'?</i>

8252
13:41:38,940 --> 13:41:40,351
Don't worry about me.

8253
13:42:38,580 --> 13:42:41,026
I have to say, I am impressed.

8254
13:42:42,020 --> 13:42:45,308
I would very much
like to know the
name of the man

8255
13:42:45,380 --> 13:42:47,826
who is causing me
so much trouble.

8256
13:42:49,020 --> 13:42:51,261
There's no way out of there.

8257
13:42:51,340 --> 13:42:52,501
What is he doing?

8258
13:42:52,580 --> 13:42:54,469
He's frozen like
a damn deer
in headlights.

8259
13:42:54,540 --> 13:42:56,349
Toretto ain't no deer.

8260
13:42:56,620 --> 13:42:58,145
Come on, Dominic.

8261
13:42:58,380 --> 13:43:01,429
Give us the girl,
and I'll let you live.

8262
13:43:01,940 --> 13:43:03,624
What are you going to do?

8263
13:43:05,620 --> 13:43:08,544
You might wanna
put on your helmet
for this one.

8264
13:43:11,140 --> 13:43:12,141
Helm...

8265
13:43:17,420 --> 13:43:18,581
Target the driver.

8266
13:43:25,780 --> 13:43:27,509
Damn it!
What is he thinking?

8267
13:43:29,060 --> 13:43:30,425
You're insane!

8268
13:43:38,460 --> 13:43:40,622
You're pointing the wrong way.

8269
13:43:40,700 --> 13:43:41,861
Am I now?

8270
13:43:49,220 --> 13:43:50,551
Fire on my mark.

8271
13:43:51,420 --> 13:43:53,149
Interesting.
Three!

8272
13:43:54,540 --> 13:43:56,508
Two!
Hold on.

8273
13:43:56,580 --> 13:43:57,741
One!

8274
13:43:58,900 --> 13:44:00,026
Fire!

8275
13:44:55,020 --> 13:44:57,227
Looks like our
demon love child worked.

8276
13:44:57,300 --> 13:44:59,064
That's one way down a mountain.

8277
13:44:59,900 --> 13:45:01,345
Where's Ramsey?

8278
13:45:15,180 --> 13:45:16,670
Hello Kitty is awake.

8279
13:45:20,140 --> 13:45:22,188
She don't look like
a hacker to me.

8280
13:45:22,260 --> 13:45:24,661
Oh, yeah? And what do
hackers look like?

8281
13:45:24,780 --> 13:45:26,748
They don't supposed
to look like that.

8282
13:45:28,180 --> 13:45:29,420
I'm just saying, like,

8283
13:45:29,500 --> 13:45:31,104
you know how they
normally wear them little,

8284
13:45:31,180 --> 13:45:33,023
weird glasses
that's all crooked,

8285
13:45:33,220 --> 13:45:35,587
and pimples all
over their face
from drinking soda?

8286
13:45:35,940 --> 13:45:38,784
I mean, trust me,
with a body like that,

8287
13:45:38,860 --> 13:45:40,669
you ain't gonna park it
behind a computer.

8288
13:45:41,900 --> 13:45:43,140
How are you feeling?

8289
13:45:43,220 --> 13:45:44,710
Did you hit your head?

8290
13:45:45,420 --> 13:45:49,106
Feeling nauseous?
Ears ringing? No?

8291
13:45:49,420 --> 13:45:51,149
Where's my shoe?

8292
13:45:51,220 --> 13:45:52,710
Oh, it flew off
when you crashed.

8293
13:45:53,260 --> 13:45:56,503
If you start experiencing
any of those things,
let me know, okay?

8294
13:45:56,580 --> 13:45:59,026
I don't know
whether to thank you
for rescuing me

8295
13:45:59,100 --> 13:46:01,262
or kick your ass
for throwing me
off a cliff.

8296
13:46:02,100 --> 13:46:04,102
Thank us or kick our ass, huh?

8297
13:46:06,300 --> 13:46:08,621
How about you tell us
where that device is?

8298
13:46:10,500 --> 13:46:12,628
I mailed it to a friend.

8299
13:46:12,700 --> 13:46:13,781
In Abu Dhabi.

8300
13:46:14,500 --> 13:46:16,150
That was pretty easy.

8301
13:46:16,780 --> 13:46:19,140
That other team
would have tortured you
for that information.

8302
13:46:19,180 --> 13:46:22,229
I didn't trust them.
I trust you.

8303
13:46:23,220 --> 13:46:26,702
Now, why would
you trust us?
You barely know us.

8304
13:46:26,900 --> 13:46:28,425
I know enough.

8305
13:46:30,300 --> 13:46:33,224
Ex-cop. Military,
something like that.

8306
13:46:33,700 --> 13:46:36,590
The way you took out
them guys shows training.

8307
13:46:36,860 --> 13:46:40,626
Tech guy, offended
by the hacker remark,
naturally.

8308
13:46:41,420 --> 13:46:42,785
Alpha.

8309
13:46:43,660 --> 13:46:45,230
Mrs. Alpha.

8310
13:46:46,860 --> 13:46:47,941
Joker

8311
13:46:48,340 --> 13:46:49,421
Wrong.

8312
13:46:51,140 --> 13:46:52,983
Double alpha.

8313
13:46:53,060 --> 13:46:55,222
Man candy. You know
what I'm saying?

8314
13:46:55,300 --> 13:46:56,461
Man, sit your candy ass down.

8315
13:46:59,020 --> 13:47:01,102
The disrespect is
real around here.

8316
13:47:01,740 --> 13:47:03,629
Life is binary.
Zeroes and ones.

8317
13:47:03,700 --> 13:47:05,862
Only two things
keep a group
like this together.

8318
13:47:05,940 --> 13:47:07,669
Fear or loyalty.

8319
13:47:08,100 --> 13:47:10,751
And I don't see
a drop of fear
among you guys.

8320
13:47:10,820 --> 13:47:13,346
Very impressive.
Just one thing.

8321
13:47:13,580 --> 13:47:14,580
They're not married.

8322
13:47:14,620 --> 13:47:16,980
She's so off,
it's crazy. You just
gonna roll with it?

8323
13:47:17,180 --> 13:47:19,626
You're telling me
there can't be
a double alpha in one group?

8324
13:47:19,700 --> 13:47:20,781
You work for US government?

8325
13:47:23,220 --> 13:47:24,824
We got similar interests.

8326
13:47:28,580 --> 13:47:30,582
Tej, call it in.

8327
13:47:30,860 --> 13:47:33,022
We're going to the Middle East!

8328
13:47:41,300 --> 13:47:42,301
Hey.

8329
13:47:53,980 --> 13:47:56,586
Hey, Dom.
It was pretty wild
on that mountain, huh?

8330
13:47:56,740 --> 13:47:58,629
No, it was too close.

8331
13:47:59,140 --> 13:48:00,426
But we got the job done.

8332
13:48:02,700 --> 13:48:04,782
You know what
the crazy thing is, is...

8333
13:48:06,260 --> 13:48:07,591
You miss the bullets.

8334
13:48:09,180 --> 13:48:11,182
Yeah, that's messed up, huh?

8335
13:48:11,260 --> 13:48:14,104
Brian, I've seen
you jump from trains,
dive from planes.

8336
13:48:15,300 --> 13:48:17,428
Hell, I saw your courage
the day I met you.

8337
13:48:17,700 --> 13:48:18,986
Right.

8338
13:48:19,620 --> 13:48:22,226
Want to know the bravest
thing I ever saw you do?

8339
13:48:23,620 --> 13:48:24,985
Be a good man to Mia.

8340
13:48:26,940 --> 13:48:29,864
Being a great father
to my nephew, Jack.

8341
13:48:30,900 --> 13:48:32,629
Everyone's looking
for the thrill,

8342
13:48:32,700 --> 13:48:36,500
but what's real is family.

8343
13:48:37,380 --> 13:48:38,825
Your family.

8344
13:48:39,300 --> 13:48:41,109
Hold on to that, Brian.

8345
13:49:46,700 --> 13:49:48,384
It's hotter than I
thought it would be.

8346
13:49:48,500 --> 13:49:51,470
Yeah, well, we are
in the desert,
so it would be hot.

8347
13:49:51,540 --> 13:49:53,180
Oh, no, I ain't talking
about the weather.

8348
13:49:58,980 --> 13:50:00,345
My, my, my.
Hmm.

8349
13:50:08,700 --> 13:50:10,225
Now, that is a woman

8350
13:50:10,300 --> 13:50:12,701
that's worth falling
out a plane for.

8351
13:50:12,780 --> 13:50:14,430
Get out of there, man,
I got dibs on that.

8352
13:50:14,500 --> 13:50:15,501
You've seen me looking at that.

8353
13:50:15,580 --> 13:50:17,264
Did you just say "dibs?"

8354
13:50:17,340 --> 13:50:18,466
What are you, in
the fourth grade?

8355
13:50:18,540 --> 13:50:20,110
Man, can you
just get out of there?

8356
13:50:20,180 --> 13:50:21,306
I mean,
it's a free market.

8357
13:50:21,380 --> 13:50:23,826
What are you talking about?
Get out of there.

8358
13:50:23,900 --> 13:50:25,390
Rock, paper, scissors for her.

8359
13:50:26,380 --> 13:50:28,030
Are you guys for real right now?

8360
13:50:28,540 --> 13:50:29,826
Look at you.

8361
13:50:30,260 --> 13:50:31,671
You both look whupped already.

8362
13:50:31,740 --> 13:50:32,866
You got stalker eyes.

8363
13:50:33,260 --> 13:50:36,343
I tried to call dibs
on Ramsey two years ago.

8364
13:50:36,740 --> 13:50:37,821
Her knee, my balls.

8365
13:50:38,300 --> 13:50:40,348
Trust me,
you don't wanna do that.

8366
13:50:41,420 --> 13:50:43,741
Hey! Ramsey!

8367
13:50:45,220 --> 13:50:46,745
Hello, Safar.

8368
13:50:49,020 --> 13:50:50,545
I see you make some new friends.

8369
13:50:50,620 --> 13:50:52,622
Yeah, some short-tempered
new friends.

8370
13:50:52,700 --> 13:50:55,385
I need the speed drive
I sent you. Where is it?

8371
13:50:55,460 --> 13:50:58,225
Oh, good. You will be
pleased to know I sold it.

8372
13:50:58,300 --> 13:50:59,586
You sold it?

8373
13:50:59,660 --> 13:51:00,866
You hear that?

8374
13:51:00,940 --> 13:51:02,271
I asked you to take care of it.

8375
13:51:02,340 --> 13:51:03,705
Why on earth would you sell it?

8376
13:51:04,260 --> 13:51:05,307
We're gonna need it back.

8377
13:51:06,460 --> 13:51:07,461
Impossible.

8378
13:51:07,660 --> 13:51:10,903
Safar, I stashed
something inside it.
It's important.

8379
13:51:10,980 --> 13:51:12,550
Okay, Okay-

8380
13:51:12,620 --> 13:51:14,827
Uh, good news. It is safe.

8381
13:51:15,620 --> 13:51:16,985
And the bad news?

8382
13:51:17,620 --> 13:51:19,702
It is very safe.

8383
13:51:19,780 --> 13:51:22,829
I sold it to a Jordanian
prince living up there.

8384
13:51:22,900 --> 13:51:24,231
Trust fund billionaire.

8385
13:51:24,300 --> 13:51:26,871
Said he wanted to use
it for his supercar.

8386
13:51:27,380 --> 13:51:28,427
Now, see, this?

8387
13:51:28,500 --> 13:51:30,150
This, I like.

8388
13:51:30,220 --> 13:51:31,631
Billionaire, supercar...

8389
13:51:31,700 --> 13:51:33,464
What makes it so super?

8390
13:51:33,540 --> 13:51:36,111
242 miles per hour, top speed.

8391
13:51:37,660 --> 13:51:39,150
And it's bulletproof.

8392
13:51:39,220 --> 13:51:40,631
242...

8393
13:51:41,300 --> 13:51:43,541
Am I the only one
aroused right now?

8394
13:51:43,660 --> 13:51:45,628
It's, like, you know
what I'm saying?

8395
13:51:47,340 --> 13:51:48,340
Whatever.

8396
13:51:48,380 --> 13:51:50,064
Where does he keep it?

8397
13:51:50,820 --> 13:51:51,981
In his penthouse.

8398
13:51:52,060 --> 13:51:53,630
Tower number one.

8399
13:51:54,580 --> 13:51:56,901
Now, why in the hell
would he keep his car
in his penthouse?

8400
13:51:56,980 --> 13:51:58,180
He's a billionaire, my friend.

8401
13:51:58,220 --> 13:52:00,507
He can do whatever he wants.

8402
13:52:00,580 --> 13:52:03,311
Now, tomorrow happens to be
the longest day of the year.

8403
13:52:03,380 --> 13:52:04,506
The prince wants to celebrate it

8404
13:52:04,580 --> 13:52:06,469
and host a party
tomorrow afternoon.

8405
13:52:06,540 --> 13:52:07,871
So you can get us
up there, right?

8406
13:52:07,940 --> 13:52:09,271
Sure.

8407
13:52:10,740 --> 13:52:12,230
But, uh, not dressed like that.

8408
13:52:41,900 --> 13:52:42,901
What?

8409
13:52:43,300 --> 13:52:44,745
Is something wrong?

8410
13:52:44,820 --> 13:52:46,060
There's a billion things wrong.

8411
13:52:48,060 --> 13:52:49,664
But not in this moment.

8412
13:52:50,140 --> 13:52:51,710
You look handsome.

8413
13:52:52,500 --> 13:52:53,831
I feel awkward.

8414
13:52:55,460 --> 13:52:57,064
You and me both.

8415
13:52:57,140 --> 13:52:58,904
Just seeing you
dressed like this

8416
13:52:59,060 --> 13:53:01,461
just reminds me of something.

8417
13:53:02,060 --> 13:53:03,266
Of what?

8418
13:53:06,300 --> 13:53:07,461
Old times.

8419
13:53:20,260 --> 13:53:21,500
You okay?

8420
13:53:22,100 --> 13:53:23,864
Yeah. I'm fine.

8421
13:53:25,420 --> 13:53:26,501
Showtime.

8422
13:54:01,300 --> 13:54:02,790
No, no, no. Listen, man.

8423
13:54:02,860 --> 13:54:04,942
They're telling me
they party like
this every day.

8424
13:54:05,020 --> 13:54:06,784
On this level,
they party every day.

8425
13:54:06,860 --> 13:54:08,620
This is crazy. I might
have to move out here.

8426
13:54:09,020 --> 13:54:12,024
I think I'm gonna
start a new culture.
It's called Blarab.

8427
13:54:12,140 --> 13:54:13,505
You know,
like "black Arab."

8428
13:54:13,580 --> 13:54:15,070
How are we looking, Tej?

8429
13:54:15,140 --> 13:54:16,221
<i>We're almost in position.</i>

8430
13:54:16,380 --> 13:54:18,269
Okay, so this is how it works.

8431
13:54:18,340 --> 13:54:20,388
<i>We got to move in sync
if we're gonna pull this off.</i>

8432
13:54:20,460 --> 13:54:21,791
<i>So let's go over it to make sure</i>

8433
13:54:21,900 --> 13:54:23,982
<i>everyone clearly
understands their roles.</i>

8434
13:54:24,060 --> 13:54:25,664
Roman, that means you.

8435
13:54:25,780 --> 13:54:28,260
You know what,
you're being real
unprofessional right now, Tej.

8436
13:54:28,340 --> 13:54:30,263
The God's Eye chip
is hidden in a speed drive

8437
13:54:30,340 --> 13:54:31,421
installed in the prince's car,

8438
13:54:31,500 --> 13:54:33,229
which he keeps in
a safe room vault.

8439
13:54:33,300 --> 13:54:35,223
I make 8 to 10
plainclothes security.

8440
13:54:35,300 --> 13:54:37,587
Not to mention the prince

8441
13:54:38,140 --> 13:54:40,063
and his personal bodyguards.

8442
13:54:40,140 --> 13:54:42,905
Security cameras are
clustered by the north wall.
That's where the vault is.

8443
13:54:42,980 --> 13:54:45,870
We got to get in that vault,
we got to tap into
the security system,

8444
13:54:45,940 --> 13:54:47,669
<i>which can be accessed
in the prince's bedroom.</i>

8445
13:54:47,740 --> 13:54:48,940
All right, guys, I'm going in.

8446
13:54:52,020 --> 13:54:53,181
Excuse me.

8447
13:54:54,580 --> 13:54:55,911
Oh, I was just
looking for the...

8448
13:54:56,100 --> 13:54:57,704
The party is that way.
What?

8449
13:54:57,780 --> 13:54:59,066
This room is off-limits.

8450
13:55:05,380 --> 13:55:06,347
<i>Now,
once we're tapped in,</i>

8451
13:55:06,420 --> 13:55:08,866
<i>Ramsey and I can
hack into the network
and pop the door</i>

8452
13:55:08,940 --> 13:55:10,385
<i>so you can get in
and get that shit.</i>

8453
13:55:10,460 --> 13:55:12,110
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
You missed a step.</i>

8454
13:55:12,180 --> 13:55:14,342
What about my steps?
What am I supposed
to be doing?

8455
13:55:14,420 --> 13:55:15,945
No, we didn't miss anything.

8456
13:55:16,020 --> 13:55:18,148
<i>You're special teams.
So when we need you,</i>

8457
13:55:18,220 --> 13:55:19,506
do what you do best.

8458
13:55:19,580 --> 13:55:20,866
And that is?

8459
13:55:21,500 --> 13:55:25,789
Shine brightly like only
Roman Pearce can do.

8460
13:55:25,860 --> 13:55:26,861
Ha-ha.

8461
13:55:27,100 --> 13:55:28,943
See? Now we talking.

8462
13:55:29,020 --> 13:55:30,431
All right, Tej, I'm in.

8463
13:55:30,500 --> 13:55:31,547
All right, find the phone jack.

8464
13:55:31,620 --> 13:55:32,985
The tap always runs behind that.

8465
13:55:33,060 --> 13:55:36,189
It's gonna be
a 350-megahertz
CAT5e cable.

8466
13:55:36,260 --> 13:55:38,262
<i>They probably got
a couple dozen back there,</i>

8467
13:55:38,340 --> 13:55:40,420
but this will be
the bonded pair
with the plenum coat.

8468
13:55:40,540 --> 13:55:41,701
English, Tej.

8469
13:55:41,780 --> 13:55:42,941
It'll be the orange wire.

8470
13:55:45,460 --> 13:55:46,541
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

8471
13:55:46,620 --> 13:55:48,349
we are in the pilot seat.

8472
13:55:52,380 --> 13:55:53,984
<i>Alright, Roman.</i>

8473
13:55:54,060 --> 13:55:55,983
Do whatever it is you do.

8474
13:55:56,860 --> 13:55:58,988
It's your birthday, right?

8475
13:55:59,060 --> 13:56:00,391
Are you Jasmine?

8476
13:56:00,460 --> 13:56:02,747
Oh, God, no.
Not the birthday routine.
Take my hand-

8477
13:56:02,820 --> 13:56:05,266
Happy birthday to you.
This way, this way.

8478
13:56:05,340 --> 13:56:07,422
Excuse me, so sorry.
I'm coming through, sorry.

8479
13:56:07,500 --> 13:56:09,980
Right this way.
Listen, excuse me
one second.

8480
13:56:10,660 --> 13:56:12,867
My brother, my brother.
Man, you ain't supposed to...

8481
13:56:12,940 --> 13:56:14,465
Sir, thank you so much.

8482
13:56:14,540 --> 13:56:17,749
All right, listen, people.
Please, everybody,
gather around.

8483
13:56:17,820 --> 13:56:19,709
Understand something, right now.

8484
13:56:19,780 --> 13:56:21,191
Listen to what
I'm telling y'all.

8485
13:56:21,660 --> 13:56:25,745
We are here to celebrate
Jasmine's 18th birthday.

8486
13:56:25,820 --> 13:56:27,743
Happy birthday, my dear.

8487
13:56:28,220 --> 13:56:32,509
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

8488
13:56:33,660 --> 13:56:35,344
<i>To you</i>

8489
13:56:35,940 --> 13:56:38,068
<i>To you</i>

8490
13:56:38,500 --> 13:56:41,026
Oh, I wish I didn't see that.

8491
13:56:44,860 --> 13:56:46,464
Ramsey,
open it up for us.

8492
13:56:46,540 --> 13:56:48,542
Copy that. You're in.

8493
13:57:02,860 --> 13:57:04,100
Do you realize what this is?

8494
13:57:05,220 --> 13:57:06,824
Lykan HyperSport.

8495
13:57:06,940 --> 13:57:08,066
$3.4 million.

8496
13:57:08,220 --> 13:57:10,302
Zero-to-60 in less
than three seconds.

8497
13:57:10,380 --> 13:57:11,984
There's seven of these
things in the world,

8498
13:57:12,060 --> 13:57:13,585
and this guy keeps it
locked up in a vault.

8499
13:57:13,660 --> 13:57:17,665
Nothing's sadder
than locking
a beast in a cage.

8500
13:57:18,140 --> 13:57:20,108
And now I really want
to punch him in the face.

8501
13:57:20,380 --> 13:57:21,586
Okay-

8502
13:57:22,580 --> 13:57:23,706
Let's get to work.

8503
13:57:31,540 --> 13:57:32,540
You got this, right?

8504
13:57:32,580 --> 13:57:33,741
Go.

8505
13:57:52,580 --> 13:57:54,867
Would you believe
I knocked him
out with my charm?

8506
13:57:55,100 --> 13:57:57,262
You ain't
that charming, bitch.

8507
13:58:09,460 --> 13:58:11,030
No, no, no!

8508
13:58:11,100 --> 13:58:13,220
Tej, your magic trick
is failing.
We're losing systems.

8509
13:58:13,260 --> 13:58:14,260
I know.

8510
13:58:15,780 --> 13:58:16,780
I see it.

8511
13:58:16,820 --> 13:58:18,060
Tej, talk to me.

8512
13:58:18,140 --> 13:58:20,620
I'm trying,
but their security system
is locking us out.

8513
13:58:20,700 --> 13:58:22,340
All right, listen,
ladies and gentlemen...

8514
13:58:22,540 --> 13:58:24,508
Oh, there he is.
These are your dancers?

8515
13:58:24,580 --> 13:58:25,786
This is a party, baby!

8516
13:58:30,260 --> 13:58:32,262
Some of y'all probably
went to the bathroom

8517
13:58:32,340 --> 13:58:34,422
and noticed that all
the hairspray was missing.

8518
13:58:34,500 --> 13:58:36,150
Yep. She did it.

8519
13:58:37,100 --> 13:58:38,101
Thank you.

8520
13:58:44,140 --> 13:58:45,790
And we're so happy
for you to be here.

8521
13:58:45,860 --> 13:58:48,784
You look like you
got some missiles
underneath that dress. No?

8522
13:58:48,860 --> 13:58:51,261
He did not just...
Did you just say that?

8523
13:59:03,700 --> 13:59:05,350
Oh, shit! Not the gate!
Not the gate!

8524
13:59:07,820 --> 13:59:09,709
Brian, faster!

8525
13:59:09,780 --> 13:59:11,191
<i>We're playing all
the defense we can up here</i>

8526
13:59:11,260 --> 13:59:13,342
but we're gonna lose.
You gotta hurry up.

8527
13:59:16,260 --> 13:59:18,183
Thank God you showed up.

8528
13:59:20,260 --> 13:59:22,069
These parties bore me to death.

8529
14:00:12,860 --> 14:00:13,861
Aah!

8530
14:00:22,860 --> 14:00:24,385
Guys, get out of
there right now.

8531
14:00:24,940 --> 14:00:26,340
You've got an army
heading your way.

8532
14:00:26,580 --> 14:00:28,230
Brian, get out! Forget it!

8533
14:00:30,100 --> 14:00:31,340
Tej, we're taking the car.

8534
14:00:34,140 --> 14:00:36,586
This is what I do.
You know what I'm saying?
As far as I'm...

8535
14:00:37,300 --> 14:00:38,426
My man, what's...

8536
14:00:45,100 --> 14:00:46,181
Letty?

8537
14:00:46,260 --> 14:00:48,103
Letty, talk to me.
Are you okay?

8538
14:00:48,900 --> 14:00:50,584
<i>Guys, I can't hold it.
I'm losing the final gate.</i>

8539
14:00:50,660 --> 14:00:51,741
You gotta get out of there.

8540
14:00:52,540 --> 14:00:55,623
Tear out the dash!
Go through it.

8541
14:01:01,020 --> 14:01:02,784
Wait, wait, wait. Now,
just hold on, man.

8542
14:01:15,060 --> 14:01:16,789
Time to unleash the beast.

8543
14:01:38,100 --> 14:01:39,181
Let's go!

8544
14:01:42,780 --> 14:01:43,906
Stay with me,
I got you.

8545
14:01:45,020 --> 14:01:46,260
Let's get the hell out of here.

8546
14:02:26,900 --> 14:02:28,140
Dom, cars don't fly!

8547
14:02:30,300 --> 14:02:31,790
Cars don't fly!

8548
14:02:31,860 --> 14:02:32,941
Holy shit!

8549
14:03:02,100 --> 14:03:03,989
No brakes!
What?

8550
14:03:05,500 --> 14:03:07,229
No brakes!
Shit!

8551
14:03:22,500 --> 14:03:24,025
No, no, no!

8552
14:03:24,100 --> 14:03:25,511
No!

8553
14:03:38,100 --> 14:03:39,101
Oh!

8554
14:04:03,380 --> 14:04:04,791
Got it!
Get out!

8555
14:04:44,420 --> 14:04:45,620
Still miss the bullets, Brian?

8556
14:05:25,980 --> 14:05:28,506
Ah! There they are.
Disaster.
I'm sorry.

8557
14:05:28,660 --> 14:05:32,710
I get you an invite
to the most exclusive
party in Abu Dhabi.

8558
14:05:32,900 --> 14:05:33,947
Safar...
No, no, no.

8559
14:05:34,020 --> 14:05:38,264
You steal the host's
car, and you jump it
between two buildings.

8560
14:05:38,580 --> 14:05:40,070
Actually, it was
three buildings.
Oh!

8561
14:05:40,380 --> 14:05:42,382
Two, insult. Three, honor.

8562
14:05:42,580 --> 14:05:43,581
My bad.

8563
14:05:43,700 --> 14:05:45,225
Well, well, well.

8564
14:05:45,380 --> 14:05:46,620
I have to say,

8565
14:05:46,780 --> 14:05:51,661
you've got an interesting
interpretation there
of "low-key," Mr. Toretto.

8566
14:05:52,220 --> 14:05:55,463
You know, Dom,
I thought we had
an understanding.

8567
14:05:56,060 --> 14:05:58,222
Sometimes you have
to play the hand
you're dealt.

8568
14:05:58,540 --> 14:06:00,702
That's why I prefer
to be the dealer.

8569
14:06:01,740 --> 14:06:02,741
Good night.

8570
14:06:06,660 --> 14:06:07,661
Ah!

8571
14:06:08,940 --> 14:06:12,069
I'm being kicked out
of my own garage.
This is great.

8572
14:06:13,260 --> 14:06:14,261
Uh, may I?

8573
14:06:16,380 --> 14:06:17,620
Brian,

8574
14:06:18,820 --> 14:06:19,946
give it to him.

8575
14:06:37,140 --> 14:06:39,541
All that trouble for this little

8576
14:06:40,420 --> 14:06:41,467
thing.

8577
14:06:41,980 --> 14:06:43,470
With all due respect, Dom,

8578
14:06:43,700 --> 14:06:45,464
you really did
great work back there.

8579
14:06:45,700 --> 14:06:46,826
All of you.

8580
14:06:47,020 --> 14:06:48,909
All of my men
are now standing by

8581
14:06:49,020 --> 14:06:52,024
and are fully at your disposal.

8582
14:06:57,060 --> 14:06:58,346
Your call.

8583
14:07:00,020 --> 14:07:01,021
Ramsey.

8584
14:07:04,820 --> 14:07:08,142
Fire it up and find me Shaw.

8585
14:07:13,220 --> 14:07:14,904
Oh, damn, this is crazy.

8586
14:07:15,860 --> 14:07:16,907
Thank you.

8587
14:07:17,940 --> 14:07:20,511
All right, give me a second.

8588
14:07:23,740 --> 14:07:24,901
What is it doing now?

8589
14:07:25,100 --> 14:07:26,511
It's hunting.

8590
14:07:27,260 --> 14:07:29,220
Hacking into
the security cameras
at Etihad Towers.

8591
14:07:29,540 --> 14:07:32,020
That's the last
place you saw Shaw,
so that's where we'll start.

8592
14:07:34,060 --> 14:07:35,789
That's him, right there.

8593
14:07:36,740 --> 14:07:38,071
Wait, wait. What are these
numbers right here for?

8594
14:07:38,540 --> 14:07:40,304
It's bio-mapping Shaw's face.

8595
14:07:44,660 --> 14:07:45,980
It'll run it
against every camera.

8596
14:07:47,780 --> 14:07:49,589
<i>Every audio device
in this hemisphere.</i>

8597
14:08:02,340 --> 14:08:04,741
Bingo. Looks like
he's holed up here.

8598
14:08:05,500 --> 14:08:06,501
<i>That's perfect.</i>

8599
14:08:06,580 --> 14:08:08,947
Automated factory, no people,
lots of places to hide.

8600
14:08:09,220 --> 14:08:11,461
You just changed the face
of manhunts forever.

8601
14:08:13,220 --> 14:08:14,790
Congratulations.

8602
14:08:15,140 --> 14:08:18,986
Hey, can I check
my email real quick?

8603
14:08:19,140 --> 14:08:21,142
Dawn's up in two hours.

8604
14:08:23,580 --> 14:08:25,821
We're gonna go
take down Shaw then.

8605
14:08:26,220 --> 14:08:28,109
Go get changed.

8606
14:08:32,300 --> 14:08:33,825
We should go now.

8607
14:08:34,620 --> 14:08:37,669
Just you, your team, and me.

8608
14:08:38,100 --> 14:08:39,181
I thought you said at dawn.

8609
14:08:39,260 --> 14:08:40,386
My guys are racers,

8610
14:08:40,460 --> 14:08:42,110
the best drivers in the world.

8611
14:08:42,300 --> 14:08:43,745
But they ain't killers.

8612
14:08:43,900 --> 14:08:45,550
Told you
he'd say that.

8613
14:08:45,620 --> 14:08:47,782
I know you too well, Dom,
and I'm going with you.

8614
14:08:47,860 --> 14:08:50,704
Well, looks like we got
a nice little hunting party.

8615
14:08:51,500 --> 14:08:53,264
Let's go bag a shadow.

8616
14:09:01,020 --> 14:09:03,148
Ten klicks out, boys.
Get ready to rock and roll.

8617
14:09:09,380 --> 14:09:11,269
Here we go. Weapons hot.

8618
14:09:33,100 --> 14:09:34,829
You ready for this?
Yeah.

8619
14:10:05,260 --> 14:10:06,989
I hope you're enjoying
your last meal.

8620
14:10:14,700 --> 14:10:15,701
This is it?

8621
14:10:16,140 --> 14:10:17,869
This is all I warrant?

8622
14:10:18,740 --> 14:10:20,469
A dozen men?

8623
14:10:20,540 --> 14:10:22,781
I think you'll find
it's more than enough.

8624
14:10:36,700 --> 14:10:38,782
I'm ready
to meet my maker.

8625
14:10:39,020 --> 14:10:40,226
Are you?

8626
14:10:40,300 --> 14:10:43,668
What were
you expecting, Toretto?
To catch me off guard?

8627
14:10:44,780 --> 14:10:46,623
Me standing here,
waving a white flag?

8628
14:10:47,300 --> 14:10:48,665
You ever heard the saying,

8629
14:10:48,820 --> 14:10:50,310
"The enemy of my enemy

8630
14:10:50,900 --> 14:10:52,186
"is my friend?"

8631
14:10:53,060 --> 14:10:55,108
I don't have friends.

8632
14:10:55,260 --> 14:10:56,500
I got family.

8633
14:10:57,660 --> 14:11:00,266
Well, I got a lot of friends.

8634
14:11:13,220 --> 14:11:15,268
Two-two formation!
Sheppard, peel one!

8635
14:12:43,740 --> 14:12:44,866
Brian, leave it!

8636
14:13:06,980 --> 14:13:07,981
Get down!

8637
14:13:19,980 --> 14:13:21,061
l90ty0u.

8638
14:13:44,180 --> 14:13:45,864
JAKANDEI God's Eye.

8639
14:14:05,100 --> 14:14:07,944
You didn't really think
I was gonna walk in
there naked, did you?

8640
14:14:10,180 --> 14:14:11,944
You got hit bad.

8641
14:14:12,580 --> 14:14:14,070
Look, Toretto.

8642
14:14:14,820 --> 14:14:17,027
I know you won't listen to me.

8643
14:14:17,620 --> 14:14:20,351
You're not gonna want to
hear what I have to say.

8644
14:14:20,420 --> 14:14:22,741
But the truth is,

8645
14:14:22,900 --> 14:14:24,550
you really ought to

8646
14:14:25,140 --> 14:14:27,586
try that Belgian ale, man.

8647
14:14:27,740 --> 14:14:29,742
It's something special.

8648
14:14:29,940 --> 14:14:31,749
Belgian ale, huh?

8649
14:14:33,820 --> 14:14:35,822
Hey, we gotta get
you to a hospital.

8650
14:14:35,980 --> 14:14:37,220
No, you're not.

8651
14:14:37,580 --> 14:14:40,504
I carry my own health insurance.

8652
14:14:41,180 --> 14:14:45,265
SOCOM medics on standby.
They're already inbound.

8653
14:14:46,420 --> 14:14:48,184
Pull over, kid.

8654
14:15:02,500 --> 14:15:04,423
Dom,
you gotta protect Ramsey.

8655
14:15:04,580 --> 14:15:06,423
As long as she's alive,

8656
14:15:07,300 --> 14:15:09,541
she can lock them
out of God's Eye,
and they know that.

8657
14:15:09,700 --> 14:15:12,909
That means they're
not gonna stop coming
until they've got her.

8658
14:15:13,260 --> 14:15:14,910
And this time, when they come

8659
14:15:15,060 --> 14:15:17,904
they're gonna come
with everything they've got.

8660
14:15:18,100 --> 14:15:19,261
I'm not leaving you.

8661
14:15:19,340 --> 14:15:20,466
You're not.

8662
14:15:20,860 --> 14:15:22,908
I'm leaving you.

8663
14:15:25,140 --> 14:15:26,983
Go now, Dom.

8664
14:15:40,700 --> 14:15:43,021
A war is coming to us,
whether we like it or not.

8665
14:15:44,380 --> 14:15:46,587
If a war is coming,

8666
14:15:48,460 --> 14:15:51,782
we're gonna face them on
the streets we know best.

8667
14:15:56,900 --> 14:15:59,824
I'm all for winging it,
but this is crazy, man.

8668
14:15:59,980 --> 14:16:03,109
We got mercenaries with
some real heat on us.

8669
14:16:03,540 --> 14:16:05,140
I mean, I ain't scared
or nothing, but...

8670
14:16:05,740 --> 14:16:07,026
Man, I don't even have a gun!

8671
14:16:08,700 --> 14:16:09,940
Gun?

8672
14:16:11,220 --> 14:16:12,790
We got a whole city.

8673
14:16:12,940 --> 14:16:15,261
And we may have
more than that.
If they use God's Eye,

8674
14:16:15,460 --> 14:16:17,747
it'll tap the cameras
around town to
find our location.

8675
14:16:18,100 --> 14:16:20,421
Which means we could
plant a virus.

8676
14:16:20,580 --> 14:16:22,742
And then break in
when they access it.

8677
14:16:23,260 --> 14:16:25,627
So you're talking about
hacking my hacking device.

8678
14:16:25,780 --> 14:16:26,986
It's brilliant.

8679
14:16:27,180 --> 14:16:28,750
Yeah, but there's one problem.

8680
14:16:28,900 --> 14:16:30,106
The signal strength.

8681
14:16:30,260 --> 14:16:33,503
We can't start a hack
on them until they're
within a two-mile range.

8682
14:16:34,020 --> 14:16:35,704
- That's really close.
- Close?

8683
14:16:35,900 --> 14:16:36,947
These guys are military.

8684
14:16:37,100 --> 14:16:39,467
If they're within
two miles of us,
we're already dead.

8685
14:16:39,620 --> 14:16:44,069
I don't know about y'all,
but I didn't really plan
on dying today.

8686
14:16:44,220 --> 14:16:46,188
Only one way
to stay alive.

8687
14:16:47,060 --> 14:16:49,506
We play keep-away
with Ramsey.
What?

8688
14:16:49,620 --> 14:16:50,951
They can't hit
us if we keep moving.

8689
14:16:51,100 --> 14:16:52,943
And I'll take Shaw.

8690
14:16:53,220 --> 14:16:54,585
So, basically,
we're just gearing up

8691
14:16:54,660 --> 14:16:55,980
for a big game of
hot potato, huh?

8692
14:16:56,100 --> 14:16:57,181
Which car
is the potato?

8693
14:16:57,260 --> 14:16:58,460
Girl,
you're the potato.

8694
14:16:58,820 --> 14:17:01,300
Why does it feel like
I'm not gonna see you again?

8695
14:17:14,860 --> 14:17:16,669
I'll come back for that.

8696
14:17:17,980 --> 14:17:19,220
Promise?

8697
14:17:21,580 --> 14:17:22,945
Promise.

8698
14:17:42,580 --> 14:17:44,628
- Brian, are you okay?
- <i>Mia, listen  to me.</i>

8699
14:17:45,740 --> 14:17:47,583
Something's about to go down.

8700
14:17:47,660 --> 14:17:49,867
<i>And if you don't hear
from me in 24 hours,</i>

8701
14:17:52,500 --> 14:17:55,151
I need you to take
Jack and move on.

8702
14:17:57,460 --> 14:17:58,791
You understand?

8703
14:18:00,220 --> 14:18:01,460
<i>You understand what I'm saying?</i>

8704
14:18:01,500 --> 14:18:03,389
No, I can't do that, Brian.

8705
14:18:03,620 --> 14:18:05,304
<i>No, I can't.</i>

8706
14:18:06,580 --> 14:18:08,787
We're gonna have another baby.

8707
14:18:09,380 --> 14:18:10,711
It's a little girl.

8708
14:18:13,660 --> 14:18:15,020
<i>And she's going to
need her father.</i>

8709
14:18:15,100 --> 14:18:17,307
So you have to finish
what you're doing

8710
14:18:17,380 --> 14:18:19,860
<i>and you have to
come home to her.</i>

8711
14:18:20,460 --> 14:18:21,791
You have to come home to us.

8712
14:18:23,620 --> 14:18:25,861
<i>I'm sorry I didn't
tell you before.</i>

8713
14:18:26,380 --> 14:18:30,101
I was scared
you'd be disappointed
with domestic life.

8714
14:18:32,020 --> 14:18:35,866
You know,
the best decision I ever made
was stepping into the store

8715
14:18:36,700 --> 14:18:38,111
and buying that first sandwich.

8716
14:18:40,660 --> 14:18:42,867
It was such a bad sandwich.

8717
14:18:44,140 --> 14:18:45,790
I know, right?
But I ate a lot of them.

8718
14:18:48,740 --> 14:18:49,741
Uh...

8719
14:18:55,740 --> 14:18:57,344
I love you, Mia.

8720
14:19:00,300 --> 14:19:01,301
Don't do that.

8721
14:19:01,580 --> 14:19:02,706
What?

8722
14:19:02,860 --> 14:19:03,861
<i>The way you said it.</i>

8723
14:19:04,020 --> 14:19:05,749
It's like goodbye.
Say something else.

8724
14:19:07,580 --> 14:19:09,389
Okay. Kiss Jack for me.

8725
14:19:11,780 --> 14:19:13,020
I will.

8726
14:19:19,620 --> 14:19:21,509
I love you, Brian.

8727
14:19:24,860 --> 14:19:26,305
I love you, Mia.

8728
14:19:58,100 --> 14:19:59,340
One last ride.

8729
14:21:08,060 --> 14:21:09,983
Boot up God's Eye.
Find them.

8730
14:21:23,980 --> 14:21:25,027
I'm getting something.

8731
14:21:29,100 --> 14:21:30,670
I got a positive ID.
It's Toretto.

8732
14:21:32,220 --> 14:21:34,188
God's Eye is placing him
at Hill and Seventh.

8733
14:21:38,460 --> 14:21:39,666
Should we follow him?

8734
14:21:39,820 --> 14:21:41,709
No. Let Shaw
take care of him.

8735
14:21:41,860 --> 14:21:42,907
Find Ramsey.

8736
14:21:42,980 --> 14:21:43,981
Yes, sir.

8737
14:21:50,820 --> 14:21:53,260
I don't know
why we gotta keep
driving around like this.

8738
14:21:53,300 --> 14:21:54,904
Why can't we just
pull over somewhere,

8739
14:21:54,980 --> 14:21:57,631
park, gather our
thoughts in, like,
a bunker somewhere?

8740
14:21:57,700 --> 14:21:59,304
Because it does not
work like that.

8741
14:21:59,620 --> 14:22:01,349
We gotta stick close
enough to the bad guys

8742
14:22:01,420 --> 14:22:03,548
in order to get in range
for Ramsey to hack them.

8743
14:22:03,620 --> 14:22:06,464
But we gotta be mobile
enough not to get shot
like fish in a barrel.

8744
14:22:06,540 --> 14:22:08,060
So, do me a favor,
focus on the mission

8745
14:22:08,100 --> 14:22:09,511
and keep us from getting killed.

8746
14:22:11,220 --> 14:22:13,029
Got her. Target acquired.

8747
14:22:13,100 --> 14:22:14,989
She's riding shotgun
in a blue GT-R.

8748
14:22:23,300 --> 14:22:24,301
Guys, they're here.

8749
14:22:24,820 --> 14:22:25,821
How many cars?

8750
14:22:25,900 --> 14:22:26,947
Uh, none.

8751
14:22:27,140 --> 14:22:28,744
<i>And that's kind of the problem.</i>

8752
14:22:35,860 --> 14:22:37,669
Okay, let's give them the tour.

8753
14:22:37,740 --> 14:22:38,866
Break on my mark.

8754
14:22:38,940 --> 14:22:41,022
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

8755
14:22:41,140 --> 14:22:42,266
Go!

8756
14:22:46,140 --> 14:22:47,505
Splitting up won't work.

8757
14:22:47,660 --> 14:22:49,344
Can't hide from God's Eye.

8758
14:22:53,300 --> 14:22:54,301
They're in range.

8759
14:22:54,620 --> 14:22:56,065
Ramsey, start the hack.

8760
14:22:56,220 --> 14:22:57,551
Initiating.

8761
14:22:58,460 --> 14:22:59,461
Now.

8762
14:23:01,820 --> 14:23:03,982
Sir, I think
someone's trying
to hack the system.

8763
14:23:04,740 --> 14:23:05,901
It's Ramsey.

8764
14:23:06,060 --> 14:23:07,266
Send in the Predator!

8765
14:23:07,420 --> 14:23:08,581
Take her out!

8766
14:23:08,780 --> 14:23:10,509
Releasing Predator.

8767
14:23:42,140 --> 14:23:43,346
I think we lost the chopper.

8768
14:23:49,380 --> 14:23:51,348
I think we got
bigger problems than that!

8769
14:23:53,300 --> 14:23:54,665
Oh, my God.

8770
14:23:56,780 --> 14:23:57,781
What are you doing?

8771
14:23:57,940 --> 14:23:58,987
We're going old school!

8772
14:24:05,620 --> 14:24:06,701
Watch out!

8773
14:25:21,140 --> 14:25:22,380
It's coming
back around!

8774
14:25:35,100 --> 14:25:36,226
Predator's back on him.

8775
14:25:36,540 --> 14:25:38,304
- Ready missiles!
- Roger that.

8776
14:25:40,140 --> 14:25:41,380
Fire!

8777
14:25:42,460 --> 14:25:43,461
Oh, shit!

8778
14:25:53,260 --> 14:25:54,785
Football's hot!
I need to lateral!

8779
14:25:54,860 --> 14:25:56,066
Rome, where are you?

8780
14:25:56,140 --> 14:25:57,505
Running back charging in!

8781
14:26:16,060 --> 14:26:18,427
Meet me on Third and Spring.
You got it!

8782
14:26:25,580 --> 14:26:26,741
I'm halfway there.

8783
14:26:26,900 --> 14:26:28,026
Grab your computer!
Get in the window!

8784
14:26:28,180 --> 14:26:29,306
Why?
Do it! Now!

8785
14:26:34,700 --> 14:26:36,031
You gotta go! Right now!

8786
14:26:40,460 --> 14:26:41,871
Fire!

8787
14:26:52,420 --> 14:26:53,501
Come on!

8788
14:27:12,300 --> 14:27:13,745
Hit!

8789
14:27:17,140 --> 14:27:18,301
He made it!

8790
14:27:18,500 --> 14:27:20,150
I can't believe
we pulled that off.

8791
14:27:27,540 --> 14:27:29,463
Wait, wait, wait.
We're still being hacked.
What?

8792
14:27:29,540 --> 14:27:31,383
God's Eye is
still tracking Ramsey.

8793
14:27:31,460 --> 14:27:32,950
Keep the drone
in pursuit of her.

8794
14:27:33,020 --> 14:27:34,700
The signal has to be
coming from somewhere.

8795
14:28:11,740 --> 14:28:14,425
<i>Back to
throw. Here comes the blitz-
Number 94 sacks him!</i>

8796
14:28:14,500 --> 14:28:16,867
<i>Breaking news
out of Los Angeles tonight.</i>

8797
14:28:16,940 --> 14:28:19,864
<i>In what can only be described
as vehicular warfare,</i>

8798
14:28:19,940 --> 14:28:21,749
<i>police are engaged in
a high-speed pursuit...</i>

8799
14:28:24,660 --> 14:28:26,185
I got it. They're
piggybacking the hack

8800
14:28:26,260 --> 14:28:27,700
off that satellite
tower right there.

8801
14:28:27,740 --> 14:28:29,265
Take it out!

8802
14:28:40,900 --> 14:28:41,947
Toretto.

8803
14:28:51,180 --> 14:28:53,140
Wait. What happened?
We were almost there.

8804
14:28:53,500 --> 14:28:55,502
They've cut the signal!
I can't finish the hack!

8805
14:28:55,580 --> 14:28:56,581
What do you mean?

8806
14:28:58,540 --> 14:29:00,065
Brian, they took out the tower!

8807
14:29:05,020 --> 14:29:07,591
Dad,
what's going on?

8808
14:29:08,740 --> 14:29:10,230
Daddy's gotta go to work.

8809
14:29:28,420 --> 14:29:29,501
All right, baby girl.

8810
14:29:29,660 --> 14:29:31,389
Elena's gonna be here
in a little bit.

8811
14:29:31,540 --> 14:29:32,780
You know our drill.

8812
14:29:32,860 --> 14:29:34,191
Give me three for the road.

8813
14:29:52,900 --> 14:29:54,948
You thought this was
gonna be a street fight?

8814
14:30:09,620 --> 14:30:11,429
You're goddamn right it is.

8815
14:30:57,860 --> 14:30:58,907
There has to be another way.

8816
14:30:58,980 --> 14:31:00,391
Wait. I'm seeing
half a dozen

8817
14:31:00,460 --> 14:31:02,588
<i>cell towers between
Sixth and State.</i>

8818
14:31:02,660 --> 14:31:03,900
Brian, if you can get to the top

8819
14:31:03,940 --> 14:31:05,544
<i>of any one of those
buildings around there,</i>

8820
14:31:05,620 --> 14:31:07,827
we can reroute
the signal manually
and finish the job.

8821
14:31:07,900 --> 14:31:08,901
I'm on it.

8822
14:31:12,220 --> 14:31:13,346
Sir, did you hear that?

8823
14:31:13,420 --> 14:31:15,422
O'Conner is on foot,
heading for a repeater.

8824
14:31:15,500 --> 14:31:16,945
He's going to try to
reinitiate the hack.

8825
14:31:17,020 --> 14:31:18,100
Keep the drone on the girl.

8826
14:31:19,540 --> 14:31:20,541
<i>Net,</i>

8827
14:31:20,620 --> 14:31:22,660
O'Conner's on foot
somewhere between
<i>Sixth</i> and State-

8828
14:31:23,060 --> 14:31:24,471
Don't let him make it there.

8829
14:31:39,660 --> 14:31:40,661
Them boys is on us!

8830
14:31:40,740 --> 14:31:42,265
Man, them boys
ain't ready for this!

8831
14:31:47,300 --> 14:31:48,506
Shit!

8832
14:32:07,020 --> 14:32:08,988
First the tank, then the plane.

8833
14:32:09,060 --> 14:32:10,346
Now we got a spaceship?

8834
14:32:10,380 --> 14:32:12,621
That's not a spaceship,
that's a drone!
Oh, it's a drone?

8835
14:32:12,700 --> 14:32:14,543
Now, you gonna break it down
and be articulate

8836
14:32:14,620 --> 14:32:16,509
like you already know
what the hell is going on?

8837
14:32:16,580 --> 14:32:18,309
Shut your ass up
and drive the car!

8838
14:32:24,940 --> 14:32:26,704
Letty, the football's on fire!

8839
14:32:26,780 --> 14:32:27,781
We need help!

8840
14:32:29,460 --> 14:32:30,507
Hang on! I'm coming!

8841
14:33:06,100 --> 14:33:07,511
Ramsey, get ready to go again!

8842
14:33:10,500 --> 14:33:12,468
Drone has missile lock.
Fire!

8843
14:33:22,260 --> 14:33:23,421
Target destroyed.

8844
14:33:26,780 --> 14:33:29,511
<i>Let's see if we have a connection.
If I can get back in...</i>

8845
14:33:29,620 --> 14:33:30,826
Wait, wait, wait!
God's Eye still has her.

8846
14:33:30,900 --> 14:33:32,026
How can that be?

8847
14:33:46,660 --> 14:33:48,503
Get up. Come on!

8848
14:33:49,540 --> 14:33:50,580
Let's go! Let's go!

8849
14:33:54,540 --> 14:33:56,781
They switched her
under the bridge.
What?

8850
14:33:59,780 --> 14:34:02,306
Gotta get out of here.
It's on your trail
and it's coming fast.

8851
14:34:02,380 --> 14:34:03,381
Got it.

8852
14:34:03,460 --> 14:34:06,145
So, if this car goes down,
who's coming to save us?

8853
14:34:06,220 --> 14:34:08,461
Save us, honey?
We're it.

8854
14:34:08,540 --> 14:34:09,541
Where are they now?

8855
14:34:09,660 --> 14:34:10,991
Six blocks east, hauling ass.

8856
14:34:12,300 --> 14:34:13,540
Where are we
headed, Tej?

8857
14:34:13,580 --> 14:34:15,787
<i>There's a service
elevator past
the maintenance sector.</i>

8858
14:34:15,860 --> 14:34:17,988
<i>It'll take you
directly up to the repeater.</i>

8859
14:34:18,060 --> 14:34:19,505
<i>Brian, you gotta hurry!</i>

8860
14:36:20,340 --> 14:36:21,466
Too slow!

8861
14:36:37,100 --> 14:36:38,101
It's coming back!

8862
14:36:38,180 --> 14:36:39,261
We'll lose them in the tunnel

8863
14:36:40,620 --> 14:36:41,985
Got it.
Fire!

8864
14:36:58,900 --> 14:37:00,345
I can't shake this thing!

8865
14:37:03,500 --> 14:37:05,343
Predator has missile lock.

8866
14:37:05,460 --> 14:37:06,985
Take it out!

8867
14:37:33,100 --> 14:37:34,147
No way.

8868
14:37:45,580 --> 14:37:46,991
Wait! What happened?

8869
14:37:47,340 --> 14:37:49,741
Sir, someone just
double-tapped our drone.

8870
14:37:49,820 --> 14:37:50,901
What?

8871
14:37:52,940 --> 14:37:54,544
Hey, did you bring the cavalry?

8872
14:37:55,380 --> 14:37:57,860
Woman, I am the cavalry.

8873
14:37:58,860 --> 14:38:00,021
Of course you are.

8874
14:38:01,180 --> 14:38:02,306
Who is that?

8875
14:38:05,580 --> 14:38:06,820
That's Hobbs.

8876
14:38:15,660 --> 14:38:16,786
I'm at the repeater.

8877
14:38:16,860 --> 14:38:18,100
The access cable's in the base.

8878
14:38:18,500 --> 14:38:21,265
<i>Just plug it into your phone
and Ramsey will
be back online.</i>

8879
14:38:23,060 --> 14:38:24,061
Ramsey, go!

8880
14:38:28,420 --> 14:38:30,229
Brian did it. We're back in!

8881
14:38:35,460 --> 14:38:36,746
We've got God's Eye back.

8882
14:38:44,380 --> 14:38:45,461
We lost the God's Eye!

8883
14:38:45,620 --> 14:38:47,031
What? Shit!

8884
14:38:51,980 --> 14:38:54,381
Military's inbound.
Three minutes and closing.

8885
14:38:54,540 --> 14:38:55,940
We need to get
the hell out of here.

8886
14:38:58,140 --> 14:38:59,904
Tej, Roman, I'm on my way!

8887
14:39:00,220 --> 14:39:01,660
All right, homie,
I'll see you there.

8888
14:39:49,060 --> 14:39:50,664
I have eyes on Toretto.

8889
14:40:11,100 --> 14:40:12,261
Shaw is in the way.

8890
14:40:12,420 --> 14:40:14,787
Then it seems our
friendship is at an end.

8891
14:40:15,620 --> 14:40:16,621
Do it!

8892
14:40:32,460 --> 14:40:33,985
Thing about street fights,

8893
14:40:36,460 --> 14:40:38,383
the street always wins.

8894
14:41:06,380 --> 14:41:08,223
Goodbye, Toretto.

8895
14:41:16,580 --> 14:41:18,742
Take him out!
Take down the bastard!

8896
14:41:28,700 --> 14:41:29,701
This son of a...

8897
14:41:44,380 --> 14:41:45,506
No!

8898
14:41:46,380 --> 14:41:47,870
Duck!

8899
14:41:47,940 --> 14:41:50,989
I need some
help over here!
We're getting nailed!

8900
14:41:51,340 --> 14:41:53,069
<i>I need some backup!</i>

8901
14:42:01,220 --> 14:42:03,791
No! No! Son of a bitch!

8902
14:42:06,020 --> 14:42:07,385
He's getting away!

8903
14:42:07,460 --> 14:42:08,985
No! Stop him!

8904
14:43:04,740 --> 14:43:05,787
Don't miss.

8905
14:43:39,420 --> 14:43:40,421
<i>Dom!</i>

8906
14:44:26,020 --> 14:44:27,943
Come on, buddy.

8907
14:44:33,300 --> 14:44:34,347
Is he breathing?

8908
14:44:34,500 --> 14:44:36,502
I want you to keep his head
tilted up, all right?

8909
14:44:36,700 --> 14:44:38,111
Keep it back like this.

8910
14:44:38,260 --> 14:44:40,740
Pinch his nose,
keep his head tilted.
Breathe into him, now. Go.

8911
14:44:41,700 --> 14:44:42,701
Good. Come on, Dom.

8912
14:44:43,300 --> 14:44:45,029
Come on, Dom. Come on!

8913
14:44:45,180 --> 14:44:46,989
God damn it!
You come on! You breathe!

8914
14:44:47,140 --> 14:44:48,471
Go, go! Breathe.

8915
14:44:48,620 --> 14:44:49,700
Come on. Damn it. Let's go.

8916
14:44:49,740 --> 14:44:53,540
Come on, Dom,
I need you to breathe.
Come on! Come on, Dom!

8917
14:44:53,620 --> 14:44:55,031
Come back! Come on, buddy.

8918
14:44:55,100 --> 14:44:56,431
Stop it.
Dom, come on! Come on!

8919
14:44:56,500 --> 14:44:57,501
Back off!

8920
14:44:57,580 --> 14:44:58,911
Will you stop?
Breathe into him.

8921
14:44:58,980 --> 14:45:00,903
Get off of him!
You breathe into him!

8922
14:45:01,020 --> 14:45:02,704
Back off!
You breathe into him!

8923
14:45:02,780 --> 14:45:04,191
Back off!

8924
14:45:05,260 --> 14:45:06,466
Please.

8925
14:45:07,540 --> 14:45:08,905
Dom.

8926
14:45:08,980 --> 14:45:11,711
Dom, baby. I know
you're hurting right now.

8927
14:45:12,340 --> 14:45:15,071
But I want you to listen.
Stay awake

8928
14:45:15,980 --> 14:45:17,505
and focus on me.

8929
14:45:23,220 --> 14:45:25,746
I remember everything.

8930
14:45:26,540 --> 14:45:28,304
It came to me like a flood.

8931
14:45:30,700 --> 14:45:34,022
<i>I remember that night
in the Dominican Republic.</i>

8932
14:45:35,340 --> 14:45:36,830
The night we got married.

8933
14:45:39,000 --> 14:45:41,651
If you die, I die.

8934
14:45:44,440 --> 14:45:46,681
And I'm not ready to
leave this place yet.

8935
14:45:47,600 --> 14:45:50,490
This moment is still ours.

8936
14:45:55,440 --> 14:45:57,602
I remember everything.

8937
14:45:58,280 --> 14:45:59,964
I remember it all.

8938
14:46:01,960 --> 14:46:04,122
It's about time.

8939
14:46:18,760 --> 14:46:21,445
Why didn't you tell me
we were married?

8940
14:46:29,520 --> 14:46:32,808
Because you can't tell
someone they love you.

8941
14:46:42,920 --> 14:46:44,251
Holy shit.

8942
14:47:10,080 --> 14:47:13,209
You sure you brought
enough backup with you,
Hobbs?

8943
14:47:13,720 --> 14:47:15,245
Oh, they ain't mine.

8944
14:47:16,200 --> 14:47:17,850
They're here to protect you

8945
14:47:18,760 --> 14:47:20,683
from me killing your ass.

8946
14:47:36,920 --> 14:47:39,571
You do know none of this
will keep me, right?

8947
14:47:43,920 --> 14:47:46,969
Well, once you dig through
38 feet of concrete and steel,

8948
14:47:47,040 --> 14:47:50,886
my fist and a body bag
will be waiting for
you on the other side.

8949
14:47:51,560 --> 14:47:53,722
So I suggest you
get to digging, boy.

8950
14:48:28,440 --> 14:48:29,441
Whoo-hoo!

8951
14:48:30,840 --> 14:48:32,285
Daddy! Come play.

8952
14:48:32,640 --> 14:48:33,687
Yeah.

8953
14:48:33,760 --> 14:48:35,444
Look at him. Look at him.

8954
14:48:38,120 --> 14:48:39,121
Yeah, buddy.

8955
14:48:40,800 --> 14:48:42,290
- Duty calls.
- It does.

8956
14:48:42,360 --> 14:48:43,361
Hey, babe, come on.

8957
14:48:44,000 --> 14:48:45,843
Let's get Mama. Yeah!

8958
14:48:46,040 --> 14:48:47,041
Here we go.

8959
14:48:47,120 --> 14:48:50,567
Because the sun is out,
I'm kind of medium rare,

8960
14:48:50,640 --> 14:48:54,326
but I can get,
like, well done.
Like, really dark.

8961
14:48:55,800 --> 14:48:56,801
What you nudging me for?

8962
14:48:56,880 --> 14:48:58,450
Close your mouth
for two seconds.

8963
14:49:00,120 --> 14:49:02,327
Just open your eyes, man.

8964
14:49:05,840 --> 14:49:06,966
Beautiful.

8965
14:49:08,640 --> 14:49:10,688
That's where he belongs.

8966
14:49:11,160 --> 14:49:12,810
Home.

8967
14:49:14,320 --> 14:49:15,890
Where he's always belonged.

8968
14:49:21,160 --> 14:49:23,811
Things are gonna
be different now.

8969
14:49:46,920 --> 14:49:47,921
One more time.

8970
14:49:50,480 --> 14:49:52,482
You aren't going to say goodbye?

8971
14:50:03,840 --> 14:50:06,207
It's never goodbye.

8972
14:51:15,080 --> 14:51:17,447
Hey. You thought
you could leave
without saying goodbye?

8973
14:51:25,200 --> 14:51:27,806
<i>I used to say
I live my life
a quarter-mile at a time.</i>

8974
14:51:30,120 --> 14:51:32,851
<i>And I think that's
why we were brothers.</i>

8975
14:51:33,640 --> 14:51:35,324
<i>Because you did, too.</i>

8976
14:51:36,800 --> 14:51:38,006
<i>No matter where you are,</i>

8977
14:51:39,480 --> 14:51:41,767
<i>whether it's
a quarter-mile away</i>

8978
14:51:42,800 --> 14:51:45,451
<i>or halfway across the world,</i>

8979
14:51:48,100 --> 14:51:49,704
<i>You'll always be with me.</i>

8980
14:51:51,980 --> 14:51:54,426
<i>And you'll always be my brother.</i>

8981
14:54:09,400 --> 14:54:10,985
- No way!
- Yeah.

8982
14:54:13,404 --> 14:54:15,365
This is the Cuban spirit.

8983
14:54:18,076 --> 14:54:19,118
Dom. Dom.

8984
14:54:35,635 --> 14:54:37,512
You know I can't make a
living without my car.

8985
14:54:37,595 --> 14:54:39,097
Not my problem, bro.

8986
14:54:40,098 --> 14:54:43,768
Dominic Toretto, I heard about you.
Welcome to my island.

8987
14:54:44,060 --> 14:54:45,436
Why you hookin' up my cousin's car?

8988
14:54:46,145 --> 14:54:47,939
He needed money, I gave it to him.

8989
14:54:48,022 --> 14:54:50,149
He can't pay, I take the car.

8990
14:54:50,275 --> 14:54:51,317
I just need a few more days.

8991
14:54:51,442 --> 14:54:52,902
"Few more days" wasn't part of the deal.

8992
14:54:53,653 --> 14:54:56,910
Come on. You make a deal,
you gotta live up to it.

8993
14:54:56,990 --> 14:54:59,576
You make a deal, you gonna live up to it.

8994
14:55:00,451 --> 14:55:01,911
"Gonna" live up to it?

8995
14:55:04,122 --> 14:55:05,665
Oh, so you're one of those types.

8996
14:55:06,332 --> 14:55:09,193
You take everyone's ride,
and then ship it back to the States?

8997
14:55:11,963 --> 14:55:13,764
You watch your mouth.

8998
14:55:15,383 --> 14:55:16,634
Now you got a problem.

8999
14:55:19,971 --> 14:55:21,723
I'm gonna keep it about the cars.

9000
14:55:24,809 --> 14:55:26,144
You want a car, get it the right way.

9001
14:55:26,686 --> 14:55:27,729
How?

9002
14:55:28,271 --> 14:55:29,480
Race for it.

9003
14:55:29,814 --> 14:55:31,649
I already own it, bro.

9004
14:55:32,525 --> 14:55:33,985
Not that car.

9005
14:55:35,570 --> 14:55:36,971
Mine.

9006
14:55:37,989 --> 14:55:40,783
Dom, his car is
the fastest car on the island.

9007
14:55:41,075 --> 14:55:42,535
Do you know what he has under that hood?

9008
14:55:42,827 --> 14:55:44,996
He knows it doesn't matter
what's under a hood.

9009
14:55:45,872 --> 14:55:48,875
The only thing that matters
is who's behind the wheel.

9010
14:55:48,958 --> 14:55:50,001
You think so?

9011
14:55:50,335 --> 14:55:51,503
I know so.

9012
14:55:51,878 --> 14:55:53,546
Then race his car.

9013
14:55:55,673 --> 14:55:58,092
And we ain't racing no quarter-mile, here.

9014
14:55:58,593 --> 14:56:00,011
We race the Cuban mile.

9015
14:56:01,513 --> 14:56:02,722
Done.

9016
14:56:17,654 --> 14:56:22,116
I appreciate what you're trying to do,
but my car is the slowest car on the island.

9017
14:56:25,203 --> 14:56:26,371
Was.

9018
14:56:27,247 --> 14:56:29,290
Pull the seats, the doors, the battery...

9019
14:56:29,791 --> 14:56:31,918
If it ain't the motor, take it off.

9020
14:56:32,835 --> 14:56:33,920
Laughing gas?

9021
14:56:34,254 --> 14:56:36,256
Nah, Fed. This is Cuban NOS.

9022
14:56:36,923 --> 14:56:38,216
You guys are crazy.

9023
14:56:40,218 --> 14:56:41,386
What are you doing?

9024
14:56:41,469 --> 14:56:45,056
Poor man's turbo.
Pull the vacuum line and hold on.

9025
14:56:45,640 --> 14:56:48,393
Old trick that Buster used to play,
in case of emergencies.

9026
14:56:49,060 --> 14:56:51,396
You know that's way too much
boost for that engine.

9027
14:56:51,729 --> 14:56:52,730
It's gonna be fast.

9028
14:56:53,147 --> 14:56:54,190
It's gonna be a bomb.

9029
14:56:55,483 --> 14:56:57,068
Only needs to go a mile.

9030
14:57:39,068 --> 14:57:40,320
Vámonos!

9031
14:58:18,149 --> 14:58:20,485
That car belongs in the trash, bro!

9032
14:59:10,201 --> 14:59:12,453
- Where are they going?
- I don't know. Let's go!

9033
14:59:27,635 --> 14:59:28,636
Ghost him.

9034
14:59:28,887 --> 14:59:30,088
Sí.

9035
14:59:48,448 --> 14:59:50,241
Adiós, Toretto!

9036
14:59:54,245 --> 14:59:55,580
Okay, Buster.

9037
14:59:56,247 --> 14:59:57,749
Let's see if this works.

9038
15:00:05,673 --> 15:00:06,883
That's impossible.

9039
15:01:26,087 --> 15:01:27,130
Look out!

9040
15:02:22,268 --> 15:02:23,353
A deal's a deal.

9041
15:02:25,021 --> 15:02:26,189
You won my car.

9042
15:02:28,358 --> 15:02:29,984
And you earned my respect.

9043
15:02:44,832 --> 15:02:46,167
Keep your car.

9044
15:02:47,252 --> 15:02:49,003
Your respect is good enough for me.

9045
15:02:54,467 --> 15:02:55,718
Yo, cousin...

9046
15:02:57,053 --> 15:02:58,429
Sorry about your car.

9047
15:03:03,518 --> 15:03:06,020
Yours was too slow for a Toretto, anyway.

9048
15:03:06,104 --> 15:03:08,773
Your Impala? Are you serious?

9049
15:03:55,820 --> 15:03:57,363
Look at that smile.

9050
15:03:57,906 --> 15:03:59,532
I love it when you smile.

9051
15:03:59,616 --> 15:04:00,909
You make me happy.

9052
15:04:01,701 --> 15:04:04,245
Mmm, I think this place makes you happy.

9053
15:04:06,664 --> 15:04:08,082
It's like it speaks to you.

9054
15:04:11,669 --> 15:04:14,964
You remember that guy, the racer and his dad?

9055
15:04:16,007 --> 15:04:17,262
The one with the boat engine under the hood?

9056
15:04:17,342 --> 15:04:18,343
Yeah!

9057
15:04:18,468 --> 15:04:20,098
- Yes.
- Of course.

9058
15:04:20,178 --> 15:04:23,139
I was looking at them, and I...

9059
15:04:23,681 --> 15:04:27,852
And I couldn't help but to imagine
what you'd be like if you were a dad.

9060
15:04:30,188 --> 15:04:32,524
No, no, no! I'm not pregnant.

9061
15:04:36,653 --> 15:04:37,737
Is that what you want?

9062
15:04:38,821 --> 15:04:41,199
It's not about what I want or what you want.

9063
15:04:41,991 --> 15:04:44,619
It's about why we haven't asked the question.

9064
15:05:11,563 --> 15:05:13,314
- What?
- You need a hand?

9065
15:05:14,566 --> 15:05:15,817
Yeah, I think I do.

9066
15:05:16,609 --> 15:05:18,903
- Sounds like you're not getting any fuel.
- Yeah?

9067
15:05:18,987 --> 15:05:20,905
Probably the shut-off solenoid.

9068
15:05:21,322 --> 15:05:22,782
Let's see if we can get some power to it.

9069
15:05:25,410 --> 15:05:26,911
What brings you to Cuba?

9070
15:05:28,705 --> 15:05:30,748
The same thing that brings
everyone else to Cuba.

9071
15:05:31,791 --> 15:05:34,252
Culture, people, the beauty.

9072
15:05:34,961 --> 15:05:36,337
What brings you to Cuba?

9073
15:05:36,880 --> 15:05:39,215
- Work.
- Must be casual Friday.

9074
15:05:41,050 --> 15:05:42,468
How's that honeymoon going, Dom?

9075
15:05:48,308 --> 15:05:50,268
Your fuel relay is missing.

9076
15:05:52,395 --> 15:05:53,646
I know.

9077
15:05:57,275 --> 15:05:58,905
I love to play games.

9078
15:05:58,985 --> 15:06:00,570
I've beaten the best of 'em.

9079
15:06:01,613 --> 15:06:03,990
But I'm kind of in a rush,
so if you've got something to say to me...

9080
15:06:04,073 --> 15:06:06,451
Oh, this is a very different game,
that I can assure you.

9081
15:06:07,493 --> 15:06:11,789
This... There's something
much greater at work here.

9082
15:06:12,582 --> 15:06:13,583
This is fate.

9083
15:06:14,292 --> 15:06:15,919
I choose to make my own fate.

9084
15:06:16,127 --> 15:06:17,545
Not today.

9085
15:06:18,171 --> 15:06:21,174
Is this the road you take
to your apartment every morning?

9086
15:06:21,341 --> 15:06:24,344
What else is different, Dom?
Was Santiago's closed?

9087
15:06:24,511 --> 15:06:26,638
Did you have to cross two blocks
to go get your Cuban coffees?

9088
15:06:26,721 --> 15:06:28,973
What is it, black, no sugar?

9089
15:06:30,433 --> 15:06:31,476
Yeah.

9090
15:06:31,643 --> 15:06:33,978
I put a lot of work into
getting you here today.

9091
15:06:34,854 --> 15:06:36,481
Well, now that I'm here, what do you want?

9092
15:06:36,940 --> 15:06:38,191
I want you to work for me.

9093
15:06:39,859 --> 15:06:40,860
Work for you?

9094
15:06:41,361 --> 15:06:43,530
Oh, I could've saved you a lot of time, then.

9095
15:06:43,988 --> 15:06:45,406
See, I don't work for anyone.

9096
15:06:45,990 --> 15:06:47,912
You can't walk away from this, Dom.

9097
15:06:47,992 --> 15:06:50,495
We're gonna have this conversation,
one way or the other.

9098
15:06:51,913 --> 15:06:53,706
You see, that's the funny thing about fate.

9099
15:06:54,624 --> 15:06:55,792
It's cunning.

9100
15:06:56,376 --> 15:07:00,004
It can bring you beautiful things,
and it can also bring you moments like this.

9101
15:07:13,893 --> 15:07:16,312
Oh, you're gonna want to work for me.

9102
15:07:16,896 --> 15:07:21,112
You're gonna betray your brothers,
abandon your code, and shatter your family.

9103
15:07:21,192 --> 15:07:25,697
You see, your team is about to go up
against the only thing they can't handle.

9104
15:07:26,698 --> 15:07:27,699
What's that?

9105
15:07:29,701 --> 15:07:31,035
You.

9106
15:07:32,495 --> 15:07:35,290
Oh, and, Dom,
I wouldn't mention this to anyone.

9107
15:07:44,716 --> 15:07:47,886
They are gonna be hitting us
with everything they got.

9108
15:07:48,178 --> 15:07:50,183
So we wanna engage with maximum speed.

9109
15:07:50,263 --> 15:07:53,683
Neutralize their shooters,
and then move on to our objective.

9110
15:07:53,850 --> 15:07:55,894
There's two things
I want you to keep in mind.

9111
15:07:56,060 --> 15:07:58,483
Number one, I chose you for this squad

9112
15:07:58,563 --> 15:08:02,442
because you are the most
fearsome warriors on the planet.

9113
15:08:02,525 --> 15:08:04,531
And number two, you go out there,

9114
15:08:04,611 --> 15:08:07,367
you do your job, and you take 'em down.

9115
15:08:07,447 --> 15:08:09,699
Everyone. And I mean everyone.

9116
15:08:10,450 --> 15:08:13,328
Mani's and pedi's at the mall later on today.

9117
15:08:18,490 --> 15:08:19,959
Monarchs!

9118
15:09:07,757 --> 15:09:08,758
What?

9119
15:09:12,804 --> 15:09:14,138
I don't wanna play anymore.

9120
15:09:15,974 --> 15:09:17,642
All right, let's go, girls.
Let's go, let's go!

9121
15:09:17,809 --> 15:09:18,810
Final two minutes.

9122
15:09:18,977 --> 15:09:19,978
Quite the cheering section.

9123
15:09:23,523 --> 15:09:24,524
Oh, yeah.

9124
15:09:24,983 --> 15:09:27,151
Yeah, it's the moms.
They come out to support the kids.

9125
15:09:27,318 --> 15:09:29,612
Except there seem to be more moms than kids.

9126
15:09:30,029 --> 15:09:31,155
Way more moms.

9127
15:09:34,442 --> 15:09:36,623
Yeah. It's a big soccer town.

9128
15:09:36,703 --> 15:09:37,829
Let's go, girls!

9129
15:09:38,121 --> 15:09:39,747
So, your intel was spot-on.

9130
15:09:39,956 --> 15:09:42,333
That Damocles 7 EMP weapon
that went missing in the Gulf?

9131
15:09:42,625 --> 15:09:45,295
Arms dealers from the Liberation
Front have it in Berlin.

9132
15:09:45,378 --> 15:09:46,421
Shit!

9133
15:09:46,504 --> 15:09:49,260
This thing can wipe out
an entire electrical grid in a major city.

9134
15:09:49,340 --> 15:09:50,800
No lights, no power.

9135
15:09:50,967 --> 15:09:51,968
Instant Stone Age.

9136
15:09:52,093 --> 15:09:54,387
Chloe, Maya,
you can't let her run by you like that.

9137
15:09:54,470 --> 15:09:57,599
- Let's go, let's go! Cross!
- Agent Hobbs, this is a Class Four WMD.

9138
15:09:57,682 --> 15:09:59,017
Do you have any idea what's at stake here?

9139
15:09:59,100 --> 15:10:01,769
Yes, I know exactly
what is at stake here, okay?

9140
15:10:01,853 --> 15:10:05,481
If the Pink Butterflies beat my Red Dragons,
that means we lose the championship.

9141
15:10:06,649 --> 15:10:09,781
Which means I have 20 little girls who
are crying, and that's not a good thing.

9142
15:10:09,861 --> 15:10:12,659
Which then means I have to spend
a lot of time in ice-cream shops

9143
15:10:12,739 --> 15:10:14,490
and a lot of time at Tay Tay concerts.

9144
15:10:15,033 --> 15:10:16,075
Tay Tay?

9145
15:10:17,160 --> 15:10:20,580
Taylor Swift. Gotta be shittin' me.
Get it together, okay?

9146
15:10:20,747 --> 15:10:21,748
Let's go, girls!

9147
15:10:21,915 --> 15:10:24,209
We need you to do this.
It's a lot of lives at stake.

9148
15:10:24,375 --> 15:10:25,919
All right, but I need to be clear here.

9149
15:10:26,252 --> 15:10:28,963
The US government cannot sanction
this operation in any way.

9150
15:10:29,214 --> 15:10:30,381
- You're on your own.
- Hey.

9151
15:10:30,548 --> 15:10:32,967
If this thing goes sideways,
you don't just get burned.

9152
15:10:33,134 --> 15:10:34,344
You go to prison.

9153
15:10:34,928 --> 15:10:36,846
And there's nothing we can do to get you out.

9154
15:10:38,056 --> 15:10:39,098
Let me tell you something.

9155
15:10:39,641 --> 15:10:44,646
The only thing that I love more
than saving lives is my daughter.

9156
15:10:44,812 --> 15:10:47,607
So, if you don't shut up
with this government bullshit right now,

9157
15:10:47,774 --> 15:10:52,487
and start showing some team spirit
and respect for the Red Dragons,

9158
15:10:52,946 --> 15:10:56,324
I'm gonna have all 20 of them line up
and kick you right in the tay-tay.

9159
15:10:59,452 --> 15:11:00,620
Go Dragons!

9160
15:11:01,663 --> 15:11:02,747
Say it again.

9161
15:11:02,914 --> 15:11:04,123
Go Dragons!

9162
15:11:04,290 --> 15:11:06,251
Attaboy. Go Dragons.

9163
15:11:06,584 --> 15:11:07,794
Go Dragons.

9164
15:11:07,961 --> 15:11:10,255
- I'm open.
- She's open! Go, go!

9165
15:11:10,547 --> 15:11:11,673
Yes!

9166
15:11:13,174 --> 15:11:15,093
That is my daughter right there. Yes.

9167
15:11:16,010 --> 15:11:17,348
Yes, come here.

9168
15:11:17,428 --> 15:11:18,429
How did I do?

9169
15:11:18,763 --> 15:11:19,764
Awesome.

9170
15:11:19,848 --> 15:11:20,849
Nice job, kid.

9171
15:11:25,011 --> 15:11:29,265
- Daddy's gotta go to work?
- Uh, yeah. Daddy's gotta go to work.

9172
15:11:29,566 --> 15:11:31,401
Now, you're gonna need
to get a team you can trust.

9173
15:11:32,318 --> 15:11:33,611
Oh, I already got one.

9174
15:11:54,883 --> 15:11:55,884
Hey, Dom.

9175
15:11:56,217 --> 15:11:57,218
Hey, Hobbs.

9176
15:11:57,385 --> 15:11:59,470
I got a job in Berlin
and I need a favor, brother.

9177
15:12:01,639 --> 15:12:04,309
No problem.
I'll grab the team and meet you in Berlin.

9178
15:12:04,893 --> 15:12:06,895
Thanks, man. I'll see you soon.

9179
15:12:33,379 --> 15:12:36,007
You were only supposed
to create a diversion, Roman.

9180
15:12:36,090 --> 15:12:37,137
That was a diversion!

9181
15:12:37,217 --> 15:12:38,968
How many of the damn explosives did you use?

9182
15:12:39,385 --> 15:12:40,637
I don't know, Tej.

9183
15:12:40,720 --> 15:12:42,222
- All of it?
- Wait, all of it?

9184
15:12:42,388 --> 15:12:44,307
Roman, Jesus Christ.

9185
15:12:44,432 --> 15:12:46,059
We got more of your fan club ahead.

9186
15:12:52,524 --> 15:12:53,566
They're still on us!

9187
15:12:54,400 --> 15:12:55,735
These guys are taking this personal.

9188
15:12:56,027 --> 15:12:59,159
Roman, we just blew up their facility
and stole their EMP.

9189
15:12:59,239 --> 15:13:02,992
Other than your doctor's cold finger,
I'd say it's about as personal as it can get.

9190
15:13:03,409 --> 15:13:04,536
Phase Two!

9191
15:13:04,619 --> 15:13:07,205
Phase Two? So you just
gonna keep that to yourself?

9192
15:13:07,372 --> 15:13:09,999
What happened to Phase One?
What about that part?

9193
15:13:10,166 --> 15:13:11,543
Yeah. Remember the airplane?

9194
15:13:11,709 --> 15:13:13,169
Everyone drove their cars out but you?

9195
15:13:13,670 --> 15:13:15,505
I told you, my engine seized up.

9196
15:13:15,672 --> 15:13:16,798
It's your balls that seized up.

9197
15:13:16,965 --> 15:13:18,132
Just follow my lead, okay?

9198
15:13:18,299 --> 15:13:20,718
And, Roman, whatever you do, don't think.

9199
15:13:21,135 --> 15:13:22,136
Huh?

9200
15:13:22,345 --> 15:13:23,513
Tej, drop it!

9201
15:13:24,055 --> 15:13:25,223
Bombs away.

9202
15:13:27,267 --> 15:13:28,309
Split, now!

9203
15:13:32,689 --> 15:13:33,940
Holy...

9204
15:13:49,289 --> 15:13:50,748
Great plan, Tej.

9205
15:13:51,124 --> 15:13:53,209
But just so you know, you missed some.

9206
15:13:53,418 --> 15:13:54,919
Oh, just wait for it.

9207
15:14:07,599 --> 15:14:09,601
Oh, shit!

9208
15:14:11,394 --> 15:14:12,562
I hate you, Tej!

9209
15:14:14,814 --> 15:14:15,899
Got your ass.

9210
15:14:22,155 --> 15:14:23,239
You good?

9211
15:14:25,617 --> 15:14:27,076
I'll see you when it's done.

9212
15:14:31,247 --> 15:14:32,373
All right, great job, team.

9213
15:14:32,540 --> 15:14:34,292
Let's break off and meet me
at the safe house.

9214
15:14:49,224 --> 15:14:50,225
A hell of a job, brother.

9215
15:14:50,475 --> 15:14:52,477
When we get back to the base,
the beer's on me.

9216
15:15:16,709 --> 15:15:18,503
You lost your goddamn mind, Toretto?

9217
15:15:22,257 --> 15:15:23,842
Toretto, you put hands on that thing,

9218
15:15:23,925 --> 15:15:26,511
you're gonna have the whole world
gunning for you, including me.

9219
15:15:31,516 --> 15:15:34,644
I don't know what you're doing,
but you better think about this, Toretto.

9220
15:15:35,645 --> 15:15:37,272
It ain't too late to stop this.

9221
15:15:49,742 --> 15:15:51,035
It is now.

9222
15:15:56,165 --> 15:15:58,209
That sumbitch just crossed us.

9223
15:15:58,585 --> 15:16:00,632
- What?
- Wait a second, what are you talking about?

9224
15:16:00,712 --> 15:16:01,713
Dom took the EMP.

9225
15:16:01,921 --> 15:16:02,964
Bullshit.

9226
15:16:04,007 --> 15:16:05,008
Where are you?

9227
15:16:05,216 --> 15:16:06,342
It's too late for me. Get outta here.

9228
15:16:06,593 --> 15:16:10,305
Saw that look in his eye,
and I've seen that look before.

9229
15:16:11,139 --> 15:16:13,224
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.

9230
15:17:15,370 --> 15:17:17,330
All right, I got his phone records, y'all.

9231
15:17:17,497 --> 15:17:19,874
It's a whole bunch of calls
to untraceable numbers.

9232
15:17:20,083 --> 15:17:21,084
Burner phones, right?

9233
15:17:21,251 --> 15:17:22,502
Nah, scrambler.

9234
15:17:22,669 --> 15:17:25,713
Same number, but they got some sort
of micro-router to bury the signal path,

9235
15:17:25,880 --> 15:17:29,676
which means Dom is clearly communicating
with somebody that's above our pay grade.

9236
15:17:29,926 --> 15:17:33,805
Look, I don't know Dom as well as you,
but if we just look at the facts,

9237
15:17:34,472 --> 15:17:36,975
Dom's been having highly
encrypted conversations

9238
15:17:37,141 --> 15:17:38,601
with some mysterious person.

9239
15:17:40,311 --> 15:17:41,688
He took out Hobbs.

9240
15:17:42,272 --> 15:17:44,023
He stole an EMP. Now he's disappeared.

9241
15:17:44,899 --> 15:17:46,067
So, what are you saying?

9242
15:17:46,234 --> 15:17:49,153
Maybe we should consider
the fact that Hobbs is right.

9243
15:17:49,821 --> 15:17:51,572
Dom did go rogue.

9244
15:17:52,532 --> 15:17:53,533
Letty.

9245
15:17:53,658 --> 15:17:55,577
Before you judge the man,

9246
15:17:55,743 --> 15:17:58,830
remember, you're breathing right
now because he saved your life.

9247
15:18:07,172 --> 15:18:09,174
You just gonna let her bump
your shoulder like that?

9248
15:18:09,924 --> 15:18:13,136
I'm just saying,
that was a little aggressive.

9249
15:18:15,513 --> 15:18:17,381
What you gonna do, email her?

9250
15:18:20,101 --> 15:18:21,144
Check.

9251
15:18:32,280 --> 15:18:33,406
Moment, will you, fellas?

9252
15:18:34,824 --> 15:18:36,117
Thank you.

9253
15:18:36,284 --> 15:18:37,702
Well, this is an exciting new look.

9254
15:18:38,244 --> 15:18:40,413
It's a little tight in the crotch, as always.

9255
15:18:41,789 --> 15:18:43,833
What boy-band bus did she fall out of?

9256
15:18:44,500 --> 15:18:45,835
It's my new junior associate.

9257
15:18:46,002 --> 15:18:47,921
He's working with me on this. All yours.

9258
15:18:48,004 --> 15:18:50,465
Mr. Nobody and I have been given
the authority to get you out of this.

9259
15:18:50,882 --> 15:18:53,801
All you have to do is agree
to the terms and you're free.

9260
15:18:54,969 --> 15:18:56,804
What's training wheels talking about?
What terms?

9261
15:18:57,430 --> 15:18:59,015
Confess to your crimes in Berlin.

9262
15:18:59,474 --> 15:19:03,353
Treason, international espionage,
massive destruction of civic property.

9263
15:19:03,603 --> 15:19:05,188
You do that, we close the case.

9264
15:19:05,605 --> 15:19:07,732
- And?
- And the DSS blacklists you.

9265
15:19:07,899 --> 15:19:09,234
Germany loves that.

9266
15:19:09,400 --> 15:19:10,985
Officially, you will be a criminal.

9267
15:19:11,069 --> 15:19:12,070
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

9268
15:19:12,153 --> 15:19:13,863
You need to work on your delivery, all right?

9269
15:19:14,072 --> 15:19:15,448
Unofficially...

9270
15:19:16,908 --> 15:19:19,410
You're off the books. You come work with me.

9271
15:19:21,079 --> 15:19:22,080
I'm not a criminal.

9272
15:19:22,163 --> 15:19:23,665
Luke, come on. Labels.

9273
15:19:24,415 --> 15:19:25,792
There is no confession.

9274
15:19:26,209 --> 15:19:27,794
There are no backroom deals.

9275
15:19:27,877 --> 15:19:30,046
I got myself into this,
I'm gonna get myself out of it.

9276
15:19:30,255 --> 15:19:32,590
- You know that.
- I do, and that's what I told him.

9277
15:19:32,841 --> 15:19:34,425
Well, there you have it.

9278
15:19:35,760 --> 15:19:36,845
Good luck in the courts, man.

9279
15:19:39,514 --> 15:19:40,515
What about your daughter?

9280
15:19:43,434 --> 15:19:46,771
You know, if you're not gonna do it for
your country, at least do it for your kid.

9281
15:19:47,638 --> 15:19:49,506
Big mistake, kid.

9282
15:19:51,109 --> 15:19:52,739
Hold on. Luke, Luke.

9283
15:19:52,819 --> 15:19:54,529
He's still working from the manual.

9284
15:19:54,696 --> 15:19:56,614
I mean, he doesn't even
really know the rules.

9285
15:19:57,490 --> 15:19:58,825
Now, come on, give him a break.

9286
15:19:59,284 --> 15:20:01,119
Give me a break.

9287
15:20:01,369 --> 15:20:02,370
Luke.

9288
15:20:04,956 --> 15:20:05,957
Appreciate it.

9289
15:20:07,625 --> 15:20:09,043
It's good to see you, Nobody.

9290
15:20:09,210 --> 15:20:10,336
You, too.

9291
15:20:13,131 --> 15:20:14,465
Rule number one...

9292
15:20:15,800 --> 15:20:17,010
Know your audience.

9293
15:20:17,177 --> 15:20:19,387
I gave you your shot. You shit the bed.

9294
15:20:19,554 --> 15:20:21,472
Now I'm gonna show you how to get this done.

9295
15:20:30,315 --> 15:20:32,192
You're dead, cop. Dead!

9296
15:20:32,358 --> 15:20:34,736
I'm gonna slice some bacon
off your back, pig.

9297
15:20:36,196 --> 15:20:37,989
Well, well, well...

9298
15:20:38,156 --> 15:20:41,910
Luke Hobbs behind bars.
Would you look at that.

9299
15:20:42,911 --> 15:20:44,704
The bent cop got his day.

9300
15:20:58,009 --> 15:20:59,385
You know, that color looks good on you.

9301
15:20:59,552 --> 15:21:01,763
Yeah, it'll look a whole hell of a lot
better with your blood on it.

9302
15:21:02,096 --> 15:21:03,765
Yeah, good luck with that, Hercules.

9303
15:21:04,557 --> 15:21:06,059
Lawman gone bad, huh?

9304
15:21:07,018 --> 15:21:08,353
Such a cliché.

9305
15:21:09,354 --> 15:21:11,022
Oh, well, welcome to the club.

9306
15:21:11,731 --> 15:21:13,525
I wouldn't get that twisted, son.

9307
15:21:13,691 --> 15:21:15,693
We ain't in no club,
we got nothing in common.

9308
15:21:15,777 --> 15:21:17,445
And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.

9309
15:21:17,695 --> 15:21:18,821
What, you bring a shovel, did you?

9310
15:21:19,405 --> 15:21:21,866
Because it's 38 feet of steel and concrete.

9311
15:21:22,450 --> 15:21:23,660
Or so I've been told.

9312
15:21:25,954 --> 15:21:27,205
Better get to digging.

9313
15:21:28,581 --> 15:21:29,582
Wanker.

9314
15:21:32,669 --> 15:21:33,753
Yeah.

9315
15:21:51,062 --> 15:21:52,272
Move.

9316
15:21:53,022 --> 15:21:54,482
Say that again.

9317
15:21:55,108 --> 15:21:58,862
If I say it again, it'll be to a corpse.

9318
15:22:02,156 --> 15:22:03,491
I'm gonna enjoy this.

9319
15:22:03,992 --> 15:22:05,076
Welcome back, Dom.

9320
15:22:05,535 --> 15:22:06,578
Nice job out there.

9321
15:22:08,371 --> 15:22:09,789
You excited about tonight?

9322
15:22:11,332 --> 15:22:12,333
You're going on this?

9323
15:22:17,630 --> 15:22:18,923
You're with me, Dom.

9324
15:22:28,892 --> 15:22:30,310
Showing me your shoe collection?

9325
15:22:30,602 --> 15:22:31,603
Yep.

9326
15:22:35,023 --> 15:22:36,816
A pair for every occasion.

9327
15:22:36,983 --> 15:22:39,861
You have enough guns in here
to outfit a small army, huh?

9328
15:22:40,028 --> 15:22:42,155
Oh, this is just the tip of the iceberg.

9329
15:22:45,408 --> 15:22:48,411
You know what I like about you, Dom?
You're a genuine outlaw.

9330
15:22:48,703 --> 15:22:51,164
I mean, you're a man
who lives by his own rules.

9331
15:22:51,456 --> 15:22:54,045
Which is surprising,
because when I saw you in Cuba,

9332
15:22:54,125 --> 15:22:57,420
I heard about a guy who almost
killed you with a motorcycle,

9333
15:22:57,629 --> 15:23:00,173
and you let him keep his car?

9334
15:23:00,715 --> 15:23:02,300
Oh, that confused you?

9335
15:23:02,675 --> 15:23:03,676
Hmm.

9336
15:23:05,470 --> 15:23:07,388
'Course I could've taken his car.

9337
15:23:08,056 --> 15:23:09,682
But it's about something bigger.

9338
15:23:10,391 --> 15:23:11,809
This way...

9339
15:23:13,603 --> 15:23:14,604
I changed him.

9340
15:23:14,812 --> 15:23:16,314
That's not your responsibility.

9341
15:23:16,564 --> 15:23:18,316
- But it's who I am.
- Is it?

9342
15:23:18,900 --> 15:23:21,444
Let me ask you something, Dom.
What's the best thing in your life?

9343
15:23:23,112 --> 15:23:24,781
- Family.
- No, it's not.

9344
15:23:26,824 --> 15:23:28,368
Not if you're being honest.

9345
15:23:29,202 --> 15:23:31,913
It's the 10 seconds between start and finish,

9346
15:23:31,996 --> 15:23:33,831
when you're not thinking about anything.

9347
15:23:34,165 --> 15:23:36,834
No family, no obligations.

9348
15:23:37,001 --> 15:23:38,253
Just you.

9349
15:23:39,337 --> 15:23:40,338
Being free.

9350
15:23:45,677 --> 15:23:46,761
I gotta tell you,

9351
15:23:46,845 --> 15:23:51,015
this whole saving-the-world, Robin Hood
nonsense you've been doing recently?

9352
15:23:51,349 --> 15:23:53,768
It's bullshit. It's not you.

9353
15:23:59,315 --> 15:24:00,942
Be who you are.

9354
15:24:01,568 --> 15:24:03,570
Why live only a quarter mile at a time

9355
15:24:03,653 --> 15:24:06,281
when you can live your whole life that way?

9356
15:24:17,709 --> 15:24:18,793
Is that it?

9357
15:24:19,377 --> 15:24:21,880
Is that all those
bloated-out muscles will give ya?

9358
15:24:22,380 --> 15:24:23,923
All show and no go.

9359
15:24:38,021 --> 15:24:39,105
Oh, I got plenty of go.

9360
15:24:39,480 --> 15:24:43,818
You must've misplaced that when I kicked
your arse up and down that office of yours.

9361
15:24:43,902 --> 15:24:44,903
Yeah.

9362
15:24:46,905 --> 15:24:49,032
Just like you Brits, rewriting history, huh?

9363
15:24:49,240 --> 15:24:52,493
All I know is, it wasn't me that was
thrown out of a four-story window.

9364
15:24:52,577 --> 15:24:53,620
Jumped.

9365
15:24:53,703 --> 15:24:56,581
I jumped out of a four-story window,
saving my partner's life.

9366
15:24:57,457 --> 15:25:00,793
'Cause where I'm from,
we don't settle fights by throwing bombs.

9367
15:25:00,877 --> 15:25:04,589
Well, that's funny, because where I'm from,
we don't need women to run to our rescue.

9368
15:25:05,340 --> 15:25:08,176
I mean, do you really believe
you can stand in front of me

9369
15:25:09,427 --> 15:25:11,721
and beat me in a straight-up,
old-fashioned fist fight?

9370
15:25:11,888 --> 15:25:13,097
Let me tell you something.

9371
15:25:13,598 --> 15:25:17,435
Me and you, one-on-one, no one else around.

9372
15:25:18,102 --> 15:25:22,232
I will beat your ass like a Cherokee drum.

9373
15:25:25,193 --> 15:25:26,611
Maybe one day we'll find out.

9374
15:25:27,111 --> 15:25:29,488
Oh, you better hope that day never comes.

9375
15:25:38,915 --> 15:25:42,168
I said no, Mr. Nobody.
I'm not leaving this cell.

9376
15:25:42,710 --> 15:25:44,562
I'll get out my way.

9377
15:25:45,421 --> 15:25:46,422
The right way!

9378
15:25:51,302 --> 15:25:52,637
Hey! Why's the door open?
Get back in your cell!

9379
15:25:52,720 --> 15:25:54,305
Relax. It's just a malfunction.

9380
15:25:54,472 --> 15:25:56,707
- Get back!
- Just a malfunction.

9381
15:26:08,486 --> 15:26:10,321
Stop him! Don't let him get away!

9382
15:26:43,855 --> 15:26:44,981
Hobbs!

9383
15:26:46,482 --> 15:26:48,318
I've been waiting a long time for this.

9384
15:26:49,485 --> 15:26:50,695
Keep waiting, bitch.

9385
15:26:55,992 --> 15:26:58,203
Rubber bullets. Big mistake.

9386
15:28:20,326 --> 15:28:22,453
Well, that took longer than I expected.

9387
15:28:24,664 --> 15:28:25,790
- Two questions.
- Yeah.

9388
15:28:26,040 --> 15:28:27,959
- My daughter?
- With your sister.

9389
15:28:28,793 --> 15:28:30,423
Toretto?

9390
15:28:30,503 --> 15:28:32,213
It's interesting you ask.

9391
15:28:33,173 --> 15:28:35,717
This is my new base. Welcome to nowhere.

9392
15:28:36,301 --> 15:28:38,135
It's a little sterile for you.

9393
15:28:38,845 --> 15:28:40,722
Listen, there's something
I wanna talk to you about after.

9394
15:28:40,805 --> 15:28:42,182
Hey, listen, guys. Thanks...

9395
15:28:42,265 --> 15:28:44,434
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What? Handcuffs? What is this?

9396
15:28:44,642 --> 15:28:46,064
It's called abuse of power.

9397
15:28:46,144 --> 15:28:47,437
You told me to round them up.

9398
15:28:47,645 --> 15:28:48,688
I didn't tell you to hand...

9399
15:28:49,814 --> 15:28:52,066
Cut 'em loose. Oh, man. This is embarrassing.

9400
15:28:52,525 --> 15:28:53,985
I'm sorry, guys, really, I...

9401
15:28:54,819 --> 15:28:56,196
So, this is how you treat old friends?

9402
15:28:56,487 --> 15:28:59,824
Friends? We don't even really know
who the hell this guy is.

9403
15:28:59,991 --> 15:29:02,035
Doesn't matter who I am, Tej.
I'm, like, nobody, okay?

9404
15:29:02,327 --> 15:29:03,536
Nobody. So, then, who is he?

9405
15:29:03,703 --> 15:29:05,413
Him? He's nothing. He's, like, less than me.

9406
15:29:05,496 --> 15:29:08,499
Clearly, we're getting nowhere with nobody.

9407
15:29:09,000 --> 15:29:11,503
I've been in here for four hours,
and my ribs are showing.

9408
15:29:12,170 --> 15:29:14,339
I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.

9409
15:29:15,840 --> 15:29:17,425
- I wouldn't recommend that.
- What?

9410
15:29:17,509 --> 15:29:20,011
Well, thanks to your botched Berlin job,

9411
15:29:20,094 --> 15:29:22,347
you all made Interpol's
Top 10 Most Wanted list.

9412
15:29:22,514 --> 15:29:23,681
- Top 10.
- Mmm-hmm.

9413
15:29:24,390 --> 15:29:25,391
That's all right.

9414
15:29:25,475 --> 15:29:28,148
- Well, not you, Roman.
- What do you mean?

9415
15:29:28,228 --> 15:29:30,605
You just missed the cut.
You're number 11, so...

9416
15:29:30,688 --> 15:29:32,774
- I'm... I missed?
- Yeah.

9417
15:29:33,358 --> 15:29:34,400
That's impossible!

9418
15:29:35,109 --> 15:29:36,361
What number did they come in at?

9419
15:29:37,529 --> 15:29:40,740
Six, eight, nine, ten.

9420
15:29:41,866 --> 15:29:42,954
- She's 10?
- Mmm-hmm.

9421
15:29:43,034 --> 15:29:45,161
That's impossible. There's no way she's a 10.

9422
15:29:45,328 --> 15:29:47,038
Oh, she's definitely a 10.

9423
15:29:47,997 --> 15:29:52,001
How about we focus on someone who
we're not gonna find on anybody's list.

9424
15:29:52,168 --> 15:29:53,962
We're awaiting hard confirmation,

9425
15:29:54,045 --> 15:29:57,882
but I believe that's the cyber
terrorist known as Cipher.

9426
15:29:58,675 --> 15:30:01,886
Wait, no. Cipher's an organization.
Not a person.

9427
15:30:02,178 --> 15:30:03,221
Not according to our sources.

9428
15:30:03,429 --> 15:30:04,514
What does she want?

9429
15:30:04,639 --> 15:30:05,723
No one knows.

9430
15:30:06,057 --> 15:30:07,976
Cipher is like a digital act of God.

9431
15:30:08,434 --> 15:30:12,438
They... Well, she can manipulate
world systems from the shadows.

9432
15:30:12,522 --> 15:30:14,194
Anything that can be hacked
is hers to play with.

9433
15:30:14,274 --> 15:30:17,902
And here's the kicker.
You'll never find her linked to any of it.

9434
15:30:18,027 --> 15:30:21,281
Her digital identity is scrubbed
every few seconds, worldwide.

9435
15:30:21,364 --> 15:30:22,699
So, basically, she's the bogeyman.

9436
15:30:22,866 --> 15:30:25,952
Damn, she's one of the hottest
bogeymans I've ever seen.

9437
15:30:26,244 --> 15:30:29,513
I mean, if y'all know her,
tell her to get at your boy.

9438
15:30:31,040 --> 15:30:32,917
- What are you, 12?
- That was my shin, mother...

9439
15:30:33,084 --> 15:30:36,754
Let's just say, people are scared
of the hacker group Anonymous.

9440
15:30:36,921 --> 15:30:38,343
But even Anonymous won't mess with her.

9441
15:30:38,423 --> 15:30:40,842
What the hell does
any of this have to do with us?

9442
15:30:40,925 --> 15:30:43,556
Probably nothing, Letty,
but I do find it interesting that,

9443
15:30:43,636 --> 15:30:47,432
apparently, for some reason,
she's now working with this guy.

9444
15:31:02,906 --> 15:31:06,534
He's already delivered a fully
operational EMP into her hands.

9445
15:31:06,910 --> 15:31:10,788
Detonate that, they can turn any city
in the world into a war zone.

9446
15:31:11,206 --> 15:31:13,666
So, then, what is it you're suggesting we do?

9447
15:31:13,750 --> 15:31:14,918
Maybe we find Dom, huh?

9448
15:31:15,084 --> 15:31:18,171
Well, first, let's catch him,
and then figure out why he's turned.

9449
15:31:18,630 --> 15:31:21,341
So, y'all want us to track Dom.

9450
15:31:21,508 --> 15:31:23,718
Yeah, I know, Roman, it's kind of a big job.

9451
15:31:24,177 --> 15:31:25,261
It's impossible.

9452
15:31:25,428 --> 15:31:29,724
Which is why I'm bringing in
an extra pair of hands.

9453
15:31:35,897 --> 15:31:38,316
Ah, my day just got
a whole hell of a lot better.

9454
15:31:38,483 --> 15:31:39,779
Mr. Nobody, you wanna tell me why

9455
15:31:39,859 --> 15:31:44,322
you just put me in a room with this
tea-and-crumpets eating, criminal sumbitch?

9456
15:31:44,405 --> 15:31:48,788
What a big mouth on a small head,
coming from Prisoner 6753.

9457
15:31:48,868 --> 15:31:50,957
Don't think we've forgotten
everything that you've done.

9458
15:31:51,037 --> 15:31:53,460
We are not teaming up with this guy.

9459
15:31:53,540 --> 15:31:56,125
Let's get one thing clear.
I ain't on your team.

9460
15:31:56,584 --> 15:31:59,838
I don't care about you,
your crew, or your little family.

9461
15:32:00,213 --> 15:32:01,301
I'm here for Cipher.

9462
15:32:01,381 --> 15:32:03,216
What are you gonna do,
apply for a job? Head Asshole?

9463
15:32:03,466 --> 15:32:06,427
You know, I think that tight T-shirt's
cutting off the circulation to your brain.

9464
15:32:06,511 --> 15:32:07,762
You should get a bigger size.

9465
15:32:08,471 --> 15:32:11,978
Cipher came to me first.
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.

9466
15:32:12,058 --> 15:32:13,560
When I said no, she went after my brother.

9467
15:32:13,643 --> 15:32:16,855
Ah, yes, brother Owen.
Who could forget him, huh?

9468
15:32:17,522 --> 15:32:19,986
Former hell-raiser and current guest

9469
15:32:20,066 --> 15:32:22,652
at a nasty little black site prison.

9470
15:32:23,069 --> 15:32:24,991
Cipher corrupted him and left him for dead.

9471
15:32:25,071 --> 15:32:27,660
So, if I get a shot to take her down,
believe me, Flex, I'm taking it.

9472
15:32:27,740 --> 15:32:29,662
You're taking my boot right up your ass,
is what you're taking.

9473
15:32:29,742 --> 15:32:32,499
Guys, guys. The fastest way
to find Cipher is through Toretto.

9474
15:32:32,579 --> 15:32:34,959
Now, aside from myself,
there's only two men in the world

9475
15:32:35,039 --> 15:32:37,375
that have ever managed to actually
track him down with any success.

9476
15:32:37,542 --> 15:32:40,340
And guess what. They're both
standing in front of me right now.

9477
15:32:40,420 --> 15:32:43,423
So, like it or not,
you two are gonna work together.

9478
15:32:44,424 --> 15:32:45,592
You got that?

9479
15:32:48,511 --> 15:32:49,721
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

9480
15:32:51,055 --> 15:32:52,515
Am I the only one seeing this?

9481
15:32:53,308 --> 15:32:55,126
Oh, this ought to be good.

9482
15:32:57,896 --> 15:32:59,022
Use God's Eye.

9483
15:32:59,606 --> 15:33:01,065
We put our lives on the line,

9484
15:33:01,149 --> 15:33:03,985
running around the world
trying to figure this thing out.

9485
15:33:04,068 --> 15:33:05,445
It can find anybody, right?

9486
15:33:06,070 --> 15:33:07,572
Let's use it to find Dom.

9487
15:33:07,906 --> 15:33:10,909
Roman, that is a great idea.

9488
15:33:11,868 --> 15:33:14,287
Did you hear that? "Great idea."

9489
15:33:14,704 --> 15:33:16,080
No, no, no, don't tune it out. Huh?

9490
15:33:16,497 --> 15:33:18,374
Mr. Nobody, let's fire it up, huh?

9491
15:33:29,761 --> 15:33:31,429
Got him. He's in London.

9492
15:33:33,681 --> 15:33:34,682
Yeah.

9493
15:33:37,435 --> 15:33:40,772
Wait. We've got a second match in Hong Kong.

9494
15:33:40,939 --> 15:33:43,483
Beijing and Seoul.

9495
15:33:43,566 --> 15:33:45,068
And Tokyo.

9496
15:33:46,694 --> 15:33:49,489
And just about every
other major city on the planet.

9497
15:33:49,572 --> 15:33:53,076
And so, God's Eye was where we started.

9498
15:33:53,201 --> 15:33:55,036
But Cipher's already created an evasion

9499
15:33:55,119 --> 15:33:59,207
that masks their location by pinging
random spots all over the globe,

9500
15:33:59,290 --> 15:34:00,875
but it was a good thought, Roman.

9501
15:34:02,252 --> 15:34:03,878
So, she's made my program obsolete.

9502
15:34:03,962 --> 15:34:06,297
And that, Ramsey, is why you're here.

9503
15:34:06,798 --> 15:34:09,300
See, simple solutions
aren't gonna cut it here, slick.

9504
15:34:11,636 --> 15:34:13,096
Why you look at me when you say that?

9505
15:34:13,513 --> 15:34:16,224
Wait a second. Wait, wait.
Simple solutions might just cut it.

9506
15:34:16,641 --> 15:34:19,939
You see, in order for God's Eye
to give off all these false pings,

9507
15:34:20,019 --> 15:34:21,938
means they have to be using a FLEA relay.

9508
15:34:22,146 --> 15:34:23,189
Watch these two.

9509
15:34:23,273 --> 15:34:25,358
Which means it has
a decaying sync randomizer.

9510
15:34:25,441 --> 15:34:26,613
Which we can reverse...

9511
15:34:26,693 --> 15:34:30,780
And track it back to the originating source
and find Dom's true location.

9512
15:34:31,948 --> 15:34:33,241
I'm telling you, they got skills.

9513
15:34:33,658 --> 15:34:34,868
That was my idea.

9514
15:34:35,410 --> 15:34:37,078
That's what I was saying. Remember in there?

9515
15:34:37,161 --> 15:34:38,746
All right, let's try this.

9516
15:34:49,340 --> 15:34:50,341
It's working.

9517
15:34:50,800 --> 15:34:54,012
Time you wanna check your manual
and start organizing a force response.

9518
15:34:55,013 --> 15:34:56,347
Let's get a hold of
our international assets...

9519
15:34:56,431 --> 15:34:57,849
He's still green.

9520
15:34:57,932 --> 15:34:59,767
Yeah, like fresh baby shit.

9521
15:34:59,851 --> 15:35:02,437
As soon as we have Toretto's location,
I want to mobilize.

9522
15:35:05,023 --> 15:35:07,650
Let's get a hold of a better asshole.

9523
15:35:07,775 --> 15:35:09,944
No one respects you... Cover.

9524
15:35:10,111 --> 15:35:11,112
Get away from me.

9525
15:35:11,863 --> 15:35:13,072
All right, they're not in China.

9526
15:35:14,532 --> 15:35:15,533
Or Russia.

9527
15:35:16,993 --> 15:35:18,119
Europe's clear.

9528
15:35:19,704 --> 15:35:21,456
But this one's not going away.

9529
15:35:23,124 --> 15:35:24,167
This is interesting.

9530
15:35:25,543 --> 15:35:26,544
Why?

9531
15:35:28,546 --> 15:35:29,756
Because that's here.

9532
15:36:10,338 --> 15:36:11,843
Did you all enjoy that?

9533
15:36:11,923 --> 15:36:14,259
Next-generation concussion grenade.

9534
15:36:14,551 --> 15:36:19,639
It scrambles your senses.
Don't worry, it'll wear off in an hour.

9535
15:36:20,222 --> 15:36:21,807
Probably.

9536
15:36:21,975 --> 15:36:24,185
Hello, Deckard. Nice to see you again.

9537
15:36:27,063 --> 15:36:29,899
Look at this, body's not even cold, Dom.

9538
15:36:30,191 --> 15:36:32,443
Your family's already replacing you.

9539
15:36:34,362 --> 15:36:36,281
You chose the losing team.

9540
15:36:37,448 --> 15:36:40,034
I guess your brother is smarter than you.

9541
15:37:14,068 --> 15:37:16,571
Smart move, embedding God's Eye
into the mainframe.

9542
15:37:17,030 --> 15:37:20,325
Irritating to make me have to come
all the way down here to get it, but...

9543
15:37:23,953 --> 15:37:25,079
Let's go.

9544
15:37:31,836 --> 15:37:32,962
Dom!

9545
15:37:42,013 --> 15:37:45,475
You're gonna turn your back
on family? Just like that?

9546
15:38:20,969 --> 15:38:22,470
Let's go.

9547
15:38:55,753 --> 15:38:56,921
You okay?

9548
15:39:00,425 --> 15:39:01,426
That wasn't him.

9549
15:39:05,305 --> 15:39:09,893
I don't know what she's got on him,
but that wasn't Dom.

9550
15:39:11,686 --> 15:39:13,024
Brian would know what to do.

9551
15:39:13,104 --> 15:39:14,230
No!

9552
15:39:18,151 --> 15:39:20,570
We can't bring Brian and Mia into this.

9553
15:39:21,112 --> 15:39:22,530
We agreed on that.

9554
15:39:24,991 --> 15:39:26,075
I know.

9555
15:39:34,125 --> 15:39:38,796
Back there, was that for her, for me, or you?

9556
15:39:39,797 --> 15:39:42,217
And was it even necessary?

9557
15:39:43,051 --> 15:39:45,053
Necessary?

9558
15:39:45,220 --> 15:39:46,638
Nothing is necessary.

9559
15:39:46,804 --> 15:39:48,973
Everything is a choice.

9560
15:39:49,140 --> 15:39:51,476
And I simply made one. But so did you.

9561
15:39:51,684 --> 15:39:53,811
You could've stopped me,
but you chose not to.

9562
15:39:54,020 --> 15:39:56,189
I wonder what Letty thought about that.

9563
15:39:58,733 --> 15:40:01,027
The problem with putting
your foot on a tiger's neck

9564
15:40:01,194 --> 15:40:02,654
is you can never let it up.

9565
15:40:03,154 --> 15:40:07,450
I think I need to remind you
why you chose to be here.

9566
15:40:34,352 --> 15:40:35,520
Elena.

9567
15:40:42,861 --> 15:40:43,987
Dom?

9568
15:40:50,869 --> 15:40:52,370
I'm sorry.

9569
15:40:55,039 --> 15:40:56,165
You shouldn't have come.

9570
15:40:57,250 --> 15:40:59,377
Nothing could have kept me away.

9571
15:40:59,544 --> 15:41:01,087
Now she has the three of us.

9572
15:41:07,719 --> 15:41:09,512
Do you wanna see him?

9573
15:41:13,766 --> 15:41:15,459
See Papa?

9574
15:41:17,604 --> 15:41:19,022
See Papa.

9575
15:41:22,901 --> 15:41:24,235
Papa.

9576
15:41:34,245 --> 15:41:38,374
When I realized I was pregnant,
you had just found out Letty was alive.

9577
15:41:40,293 --> 15:41:43,421
So I decided when Letty and you got
back from your honeymoon,

9578
15:41:43,588 --> 15:41:45,423
I was going to tell you.

9579
15:41:47,717 --> 15:41:50,845
But then she took us before I had the chance.

9580
15:41:55,934 --> 15:41:57,101
His name?

9581
15:41:59,896 --> 15:42:01,689
I call him Marcos.

9582
15:42:03,233 --> 15:42:05,235
But that's his middle name.

9583
15:42:06,402 --> 15:42:09,948
I thought his father
should give him his first name.

9584
15:42:18,915 --> 15:42:20,959
I'm sorry, Dom.

9585
15:42:22,085 --> 15:42:24,254
There's nothing to be sorry for.

9586
15:42:27,048 --> 15:42:28,299
Whatever happens,

9587
15:42:30,134 --> 15:42:32,095
just save our son.

9588
15:42:35,974 --> 15:42:37,725
Your son.

9589
15:42:58,496 --> 15:43:00,248
Good visit?

9590
15:43:02,500 --> 15:43:05,170
I know. I know what you're thinking.

9591
15:43:06,838 --> 15:43:10,675
I just let the guards go, so there's
only two opponents in the room.

9592
15:43:11,009 --> 15:43:14,012
Rhodes has the gun,
so you'll take him out first.

9593
15:43:14,179 --> 15:43:15,305
I know you.

9594
15:43:15,638 --> 15:43:18,808
And then you're thinking, Elena's a cop.

9595
15:43:18,975 --> 15:43:22,187
Maybe the two of you
can fight your way out of here.

9596
15:43:22,353 --> 15:43:25,022
So much to think about.

9597
15:43:30,153 --> 15:43:32,030
Let me make it easier for you.

9598
15:43:38,745 --> 15:43:40,622
Do with it as you wish.

9599
15:43:48,671 --> 15:43:50,882
Have you heard of Choice Theory, Dom?

9600
15:43:51,216 --> 15:43:52,717
There is a bunch of axioms,

9601
15:43:52,884 --> 15:43:55,553
but only two you really need
to concern yourself with.

9602
15:43:55,720 --> 15:44:00,391
One, the only person's behavior
we can control is our own.

9603
15:44:00,558 --> 15:44:04,812
And, two, the only thing we can truly give
another person is information.

9604
15:44:04,979 --> 15:44:06,898
So, let me give you some.

9605
15:44:07,982 --> 15:44:09,442
You see these cameras in here?

9606
15:44:11,069 --> 15:44:13,988
The moment you make a move,
highly-paid men with weapons

9607
15:44:14,155 --> 15:44:16,491
will make their way into this room

9608
15:44:16,574 --> 15:44:19,118
with one very specific instruction.

9609
15:44:19,827 --> 15:44:21,454
It's not to save me.

9610
15:44:23,122 --> 15:44:24,958
It's to kill your son.

9611
15:44:26,251 --> 15:44:28,294
Now, that's a lot of bullets,

9612
15:44:28,461 --> 15:44:31,130
and it only takes one
for you to lose everything.

9613
15:44:31,297 --> 15:44:33,925
So, I have to ask you,

9614
15:44:34,092 --> 15:44:37,387
because I know family is so important to you.

9615
15:44:40,139 --> 15:44:43,017
Is that really a choice you want to make?

9616
15:44:46,563 --> 15:44:48,606
Because I'm ready if you are.

9617
15:44:52,318 --> 15:44:55,446
If I pull this trigger,
and God knows I want to,

9618
15:44:56,447 --> 15:45:01,202
if I killed everyone on this plane,
I still couldn't get in there.

9619
15:45:02,203 --> 15:45:05,039
'Cause of your two-man fail-safe system.

9620
15:45:06,082 --> 15:45:07,750
Since I'm alone,

9621
15:45:10,336 --> 15:45:12,589
I got no choice!

9622
15:45:21,347 --> 15:45:23,516
I didn't think so.

9623
15:45:54,297 --> 15:45:56,633
You want to see the old Dom?

9624
15:45:58,968 --> 15:46:00,178
Watch.

9625
15:46:09,562 --> 15:46:10,688
Bitch.

9626
15:46:12,232 --> 15:46:14,192
- Don't, don't.
- Sweet dreams.

9627
15:46:14,359 --> 15:46:15,527
Please!

9628
15:46:19,280 --> 15:46:20,365
Damn it.

9629
15:46:21,032 --> 15:46:23,243
She wiped it all. Took God's Eye.

9630
15:46:24,077 --> 15:46:26,746
That was the one thing
we could use to find them.

9631
15:46:26,913 --> 15:46:28,206
We lost everything.

9632
15:46:30,542 --> 15:46:31,543
What do you got, Princess?

9633
15:46:32,794 --> 15:46:34,504
Finding Toretto.

9634
15:46:34,963 --> 15:46:36,714
But I got a couple of minutes to spare,

9635
15:46:36,881 --> 15:46:39,592
if you want me to send you
to the hospital. Again.

9636
15:46:40,926 --> 15:46:43,638
- Yo, Rules.
- First off, that's not my name.

9637
15:46:43,930 --> 15:46:45,807
- Little Nobody.
- Don't call me that.

9638
15:46:45,974 --> 15:46:46,975
Oh, that's definitely sticking.

9639
15:46:47,058 --> 15:46:50,190
Great. Do me a favor and tell Your Majesty
over there that we're gonna find Toretto.

9640
15:46:50,270 --> 15:46:52,021
We find Toretto together as a team.

9641
15:46:52,105 --> 15:46:53,314
And when this is all over with,

9642
15:46:53,481 --> 15:46:55,859
I'm happy to slap that
whisker biscuit right off his face.

9643
15:46:56,025 --> 15:46:58,236
Wait a minute, guys,
I think Deckard's actually onto something.

9644
15:46:58,403 --> 15:47:02,031
How do you think Dom and Cipher
got into the country without us knowing?

9645
15:47:02,907 --> 15:47:03,950
Ghost flights.

9646
15:47:04,075 --> 15:47:06,953
I thought untraceable aircraft
was all Internet conspiracy stuff.

9647
15:47:07,036 --> 15:47:08,079
It's not.

9648
15:47:08,204 --> 15:47:11,916
Satellites and radar grids
all across the globe

9649
15:47:12,083 --> 15:47:14,168
shift like an ocean.

9650
15:47:14,335 --> 15:47:16,462
They've got channels that open and close.

9651
15:47:16,629 --> 15:47:19,591
And theoretically, if you know the right
people who know the right patterns...

9652
15:47:20,008 --> 15:47:22,468
You can fly right through the blind
spots completely undetected.

9653
15:47:23,261 --> 15:47:24,971
So you know where Dom is headed?

9654
15:47:26,347 --> 15:47:28,933
Yeah. New York.

9655
15:47:31,269 --> 15:47:32,437
You see there, Luke?

9656
15:47:32,604 --> 15:47:34,647
You guys are gonna get along just great.

9657
15:47:34,856 --> 15:47:38,610
Which proves rule number two,
you never lose everything.

9658
15:47:38,776 --> 15:47:39,986
Fire up the chopper.

9659
15:47:40,153 --> 15:47:42,614
Well, guys, have a ball in the Big Apple.

9660
15:48:05,678 --> 15:48:07,722
And why are we traveling like this again?

9661
15:48:07,889 --> 15:48:11,476
Because Dom took God's Eye,
so we need to stay off the grid.

9662
15:48:11,851 --> 15:48:13,311
But like this?

9663
15:48:17,482 --> 15:48:18,611
Look here, man.

9664
15:48:18,691 --> 15:48:22,320
Before I throw up in my mouth,
let me ask you, what are we doing here?

9665
15:48:22,487 --> 15:48:24,030
That's a good question, Roman.

9666
15:48:25,323 --> 15:48:26,574
Let me show you.

9667
15:48:31,162 --> 15:48:33,706
Welcome to our new base of operations.

9668
15:48:33,873 --> 15:48:37,001
No, seriously. What is this place?

9669
15:48:37,168 --> 15:48:39,587
This is heaven.

9670
15:48:45,552 --> 15:48:48,763
It's the agency garage.
They call it the Toy Shop.

9671
15:48:55,979 --> 15:48:57,817
This is where we house every vehicle

9672
15:48:57,897 --> 15:49:00,066
seized from drug dealers on the East Coast.

9673
15:49:00,233 --> 15:49:04,320
Now, Mr. Nobody said that if we're
gonna have a chance at catching Dom,

9674
15:49:05,738 --> 15:49:07,866
we're gonna have to be damn fast.

9675
15:49:09,075 --> 15:49:10,743
Figured this would help.

9676
15:49:13,955 --> 15:49:15,331
We got a tank.

9677
15:49:15,498 --> 15:49:17,625
750 horsepower,

9678
15:49:17,792 --> 15:49:21,629
6.6 liter, V8 Duramax engine

9679
15:49:21,796 --> 15:49:25,758
with an M153 CROWS remotely
operated weapon station on top.

9680
15:49:25,925 --> 15:49:28,219
You didn't get this from drug dealers.

9681
15:49:28,386 --> 15:49:32,015
No. No, that, uh,
the United States Army lent me.

9682
15:49:32,223 --> 15:49:35,560
See, the Army's developing machines like this
that soldiers can drive from a mile away,

9683
15:49:35,727 --> 15:49:38,271
so they can stay safe and alive.

9684
15:49:38,438 --> 15:49:41,107
But, luckily, there's a backup driver's seat

9685
15:49:41,274 --> 15:49:44,777
for those of us that like
to get more "hands on."

9686
15:49:44,944 --> 15:49:46,696
I'm sitting here wondering this whole time,

9687
15:49:46,863 --> 15:49:49,782
will this thing fit in valet
at Cheesecake Factory?

9688
15:49:49,949 --> 15:49:52,327
No one is getting "hands on."

9689
15:49:52,493 --> 15:49:54,787
She doesn't go on city streets.

9690
15:49:58,082 --> 15:50:01,211
Wow. I'm in love.

9691
15:50:03,379 --> 15:50:05,340
Again, no, no.

9692
15:50:05,507 --> 15:50:07,387
That's a million-dollar show car.

9693
15:50:07,467 --> 15:50:09,177
The point is to not draw attention.

9694
15:50:09,344 --> 15:50:11,346
It's reverse psychology.

9695
15:50:11,429 --> 15:50:12,764
Dom would never see it coming.

9696
15:50:12,931 --> 15:50:14,224
It's neon orange.

9697
15:50:14,390 --> 15:50:17,435
The International Space Station
would see it coming.

9698
15:50:17,602 --> 15:50:20,063
Go choose anything less conspicuous.

9699
15:50:20,230 --> 15:50:21,898
No, no, no. Calipers are my...

9700
15:50:22,065 --> 15:50:23,194
- This is ridiculous.
- Not happening.

9701
15:50:23,274 --> 15:50:24,776
Hey, my man,
you can put that down right there.

9702
15:50:24,943 --> 15:50:28,655
This is a gift, a real gift.
I know what you're doing.

9703
15:50:29,738 --> 15:50:32,742
I like your beard.
You're Blanta. Black Santa?

9704
15:50:34,619 --> 15:50:37,163
No, I'm serious. Put it down right there.

9705
15:51:04,315 --> 15:51:05,441
What are you doing?

9706
15:51:05,608 --> 15:51:07,944
Engine's misfiring. I gotta check it out.

9707
15:51:08,111 --> 15:51:09,737
No, that's not part of the plan, Dom.

9708
15:51:09,904 --> 15:51:11,197
Clearly.

9709
15:51:11,364 --> 15:51:13,908
But unless you want
the engine to seize on the job...

9710
15:51:14,993 --> 15:51:16,411
You have five minutes.

9711
15:51:24,377 --> 15:51:26,129
Five minutes.

9712
15:51:28,673 --> 15:51:29,883
I want another visual.

9713
15:51:38,224 --> 15:51:39,475
I got an ATM.

9714
15:51:51,404 --> 15:51:52,655
I don't like this.

9715
15:52:01,400 --> 15:52:02,901
I want to see Toretto.

9716
15:52:03,068 --> 15:52:04,862
- There are no more cameras.
- Then find something!

9717
15:52:05,028 --> 15:52:06,363
Punch in on something reflective.

9718
15:52:06,400 --> 15:52:08,319
A car mirror, anything.

9719
15:52:31,600 --> 15:52:33,060
Do you know who I am?

9720
15:52:33,227 --> 15:52:34,645
It's why I'm here.

9721
15:52:35,395 --> 15:52:37,523
Do you know what I'm capable of?

9722
15:52:39,149 --> 15:52:40,984
It's why I'm here.

9723
15:52:41,902 --> 15:52:44,363
I'll give you until I finish me cuppa.

9724
15:52:44,530 --> 15:52:46,323
And I'm fucking thirsty.

9725
15:52:46,490 --> 15:52:50,077
I've got limited time,
so I won't take up too much of yours.

9726
15:52:52,412 --> 15:52:55,707
No, you've already taken everything
I have of value, Mr. Toretto.

9727
15:52:55,874 --> 15:52:58,252
What more could you possibly want?

9728
15:52:59,127 --> 15:53:00,796
To give you something back.

9729
15:53:10,347 --> 15:53:11,431
Talk to me.

9730
15:53:14,935 --> 15:53:16,645
Something's not right here.

9731
15:53:17,771 --> 15:53:22,276
First time I saw my son
was behind a bulletproof glass.

9732
15:53:23,527 --> 15:53:27,072
When he reached for me, I couldn't hold him.

9733
15:53:28,490 --> 15:53:30,409
It's the worst pain I ever felt.

9734
15:53:31,869 --> 15:53:34,580
I know you know exactly how that feels.

9735
15:53:36,540 --> 15:53:38,625
Maybe we could change that.

9736
15:53:39,585 --> 15:53:41,086
Now, why do I think

9737
15:53:41,253 --> 15:53:45,799
you're about to suggest something
really dodgy, Mr. Toretto?

9738
15:53:50,888 --> 15:53:52,848
It's why I'm here.

9739
15:53:54,183 --> 15:53:57,686
Jesus, punch in on something.
I'm not liking this. Something's not right.

9740
15:53:58,604 --> 15:54:00,981
- Rhodes, you close?
- Yeah.

9741
15:54:01,398 --> 15:54:02,399
Go.

9742
15:54:02,566 --> 15:54:04,276
The delivery truck's moving.

9743
15:54:14,494 --> 15:54:15,579
I know.

9744
15:54:36,558 --> 15:54:41,605
"Captain Deckard Shaw: distinguished
himself by acts of gallantry"

9745
15:54:41,772 --> 15:54:44,858
"at the risk of his life above
and beyond the call of duty."

9746
15:54:45,275 --> 15:54:49,613
"His bold actions saved the lives
of hostages and his teammates."

9747
15:54:49,780 --> 15:54:52,866
"Recommendation: Victoria Cross."

9748
15:54:53,242 --> 15:54:55,994
Highest honor the British
government has ever given

9749
15:54:57,538 --> 15:54:58,914
to a traitor.

9750
15:55:00,874 --> 15:55:03,210
Something about this whole thing
that just doesn't add up to me.

9751
15:55:03,377 --> 15:55:05,379
Well, that would be
the same kind of funny math

9752
15:55:05,546 --> 15:55:09,842
that says a DSS agent who has
a Silver Star for valor stole an EMP.

9753
15:55:10,008 --> 15:55:11,969
Sound familiar, huh?

9754
15:55:19,142 --> 15:55:20,143
You want to give me a hand?

9755
15:55:23,522 --> 15:55:24,523
- On three?
- Yeah.

9756
15:55:24,690 --> 15:55:26,708
One, two, three.

9757
15:55:30,153 --> 15:55:31,154
You know what, Twinkle Toes?

9758
15:55:31,321 --> 15:55:33,657
In another life, I bet me and you
could've done some serious damage.

9759
15:55:34,950 --> 15:55:36,410
- Yeah, we could've.
- Yeah.

9760
15:55:37,953 --> 15:55:41,290
Shame I'm gonna have to bounce your head
off the fender when this is all over.

9761
15:55:43,417 --> 15:55:45,627
Ah, well, with all due respect, Captain,

9762
15:55:45,794 --> 15:55:47,963
when this whole thing is over,
we're gonna find a location,

9763
15:55:48,130 --> 15:55:49,882
and I'm gonna knock your teeth
so far down your throat,

9764
15:55:50,048 --> 15:55:53,218
you're gonna stick a toothbrush
right up your ass to brush them.

9765
15:56:00,309 --> 15:56:01,518
Give me God's Eye.

9766
15:56:02,352 --> 15:56:03,395
God's Eye, active.

9767
15:56:03,604 --> 15:56:04,688
Good.

9768
15:56:05,689 --> 15:56:07,274
Let's find us a Russian.

9769
15:56:07,941 --> 15:56:10,235
I spy with my little eye,

9770
15:56:10,652 --> 15:56:12,863
a Minister of Defense.

9771
15:56:39,306 --> 15:56:41,058
Upload those coordinates to Dom's nav.

9772
15:56:41,141 --> 15:56:42,267
Copy that.

9773
15:57:05,541 --> 15:57:07,000
He's in the third car.

9774
15:57:08,085 --> 15:57:10,545
It's a Guard Class limousine.

9775
15:57:24,685 --> 15:57:25,727
Where's my team?

9776
15:57:25,894 --> 15:57:27,771
- Where's his team?
- There's no sign of them yet.

9777
15:57:27,938 --> 15:57:29,523
They're off the grid.

9778
15:57:29,606 --> 15:57:31,525
They're probably just
bunkered down somewhere.

9779
15:57:31,608 --> 15:57:32,776
We're closing in on 'em.

9780
15:57:34,653 --> 15:57:35,779
You guys ready?

9781
15:57:35,946 --> 15:57:39,908
One thing I can guarantee,
Dom, no one's ready for this.

9782
15:57:40,367 --> 15:57:43,370
I want every chip with a zero-day
exploit in a two-mile radius

9783
15:57:43,537 --> 15:57:44,872
around that motorcade now.

9784
15:57:45,038 --> 15:57:46,373
There's over a thousand of them.

9785
15:57:46,707 --> 15:57:47,708
Hack 'em all.

9786
15:58:05,350 --> 15:58:06,602
It's zombie time.

9787
15:58:14,401 --> 15:58:16,153
I'd buckle up if I were you.

9788
15:58:20,157 --> 15:58:21,366
What are you doing?

9789
15:58:53,440 --> 15:58:54,775
Safety sensors overridden.

9790
15:58:54,858 --> 15:58:55,943
Thank you.

9791
15:59:18,966 --> 15:59:19,967
Hey!

9792
15:59:28,225 --> 15:59:29,309
Target the motorcade.

9793
15:59:39,653 --> 15:59:41,655
And here they come.

9794
15:59:48,600 --> 15:59:49,601
Ouch.

9795
15:59:59,590 --> 16:00:00,841
Police escort down.

9796
16:00:01,216 --> 16:00:02,843
Take out the lead and follow cars.

9797
16:00:30,120 --> 16:00:32,543
- Two more down.
- They're still under warranty.

9798
16:00:58,565 --> 16:01:02,110
We got an army of cars driving themselves!
Send backup, send SWAT!

9799
16:01:02,194 --> 16:01:04,321
I don't care if you send
the goddamn Boy Scouts,

9800
16:01:04,404 --> 16:01:05,656
just send 'em some help!

9801
16:01:05,739 --> 16:01:06,990
Now, that's Dom.

9802
16:01:35,853 --> 16:01:37,354
The motorcade just turned on Seventh.

9803
16:01:37,437 --> 16:01:39,022
Perfect. Make it rain.

9804
16:02:37,998 --> 16:02:38,999
Target immobilized.

9805
16:02:40,417 --> 16:02:41,543
You're up, Dom.

9806
16:03:28,048 --> 16:03:29,258
Give me the case.

9807
16:04:26,773 --> 16:04:28,108
Good work, Dom.

9808
16:04:29,067 --> 16:04:30,194
Meet you at the pickup.

9809
16:04:40,704 --> 16:04:42,331
I think I know where my team's at.

9810
16:04:42,873 --> 16:04:44,625
- Where?
- Right in front of me.

9811
16:04:57,554 --> 16:04:58,597
This is on you.

9812
16:04:59,348 --> 16:05:00,766
Get out of there, Dom.

9813
16:05:01,058 --> 16:05:02,518
Guys, I know why Dom's here.

9814
16:05:03,101 --> 16:05:05,854
Police scanners are saying
he stole a nuclear football.

9815
16:05:09,233 --> 16:05:12,519
It's over, Toretto.
Get your ass outta the car now.

9816
16:05:19,493 --> 16:05:20,994
So, that's how you wanna play this?

9817
16:05:21,912 --> 16:05:23,163
Let's play.

9818
16:05:29,086 --> 16:05:30,879
Don't do this, Dom.

9819
16:05:34,174 --> 16:05:35,259
He's going for it!

9820
16:05:36,176 --> 16:05:37,469
- What are you doing?
- It's a trap!

9821
16:05:40,222 --> 16:05:41,265
Damn it!

9822
16:06:02,828 --> 16:06:05,372
Now I know what it feels like
to be every cop ever chasing us!

9823
16:06:05,539 --> 16:06:07,040
I'm gonna get a little closer.
I'm gonna PIT him.

9824
16:06:07,207 --> 16:06:09,042
Oh, so, you just gonna PIT Dom?

9825
16:06:09,168 --> 16:06:12,171
Little Nobody has clearly
lost his little mind.

9826
16:06:24,725 --> 16:06:25,767
I'm on him.

9827
16:06:25,851 --> 16:06:27,227
Easy. Work together.

9828
16:06:37,070 --> 16:06:38,071
Wait, wait, wait!

9829
16:06:39,907 --> 16:06:41,074
Oh, sh...

9830
16:06:47,831 --> 16:06:48,916
I'll take the shortcut!

9831
16:07:02,304 --> 16:07:04,223
Look out! Watch those people!

9832
16:07:05,098 --> 16:07:06,558
Big Sexy comin' through!

9833
16:07:36,296 --> 16:07:37,506
Not this time, Dom.

9834
16:08:08,662 --> 16:08:11,164
Watch the drag or the line will snap!

9835
16:08:36,857 --> 16:08:38,525
Stretch him out! Hold him!

9836
16:09:06,887 --> 16:09:09,223
He's gotta have about
2,000 horsepower in that thing.

9837
16:09:09,640 --> 16:09:10,641
Try 3,000!

9838
16:09:14,853 --> 16:09:16,021
Try five.

9839
16:09:24,404 --> 16:09:25,405
Get out of there.

9840
16:09:25,572 --> 16:09:26,615
I'm working on it.

9841
16:09:26,698 --> 16:09:28,575
Stop working on it and do it.

9842
16:09:41,004 --> 16:09:42,798
No, no, no, this my Bentley!

9843
16:09:53,433 --> 16:09:55,143
No! No!

9844
16:10:22,713 --> 16:10:24,715
Get that case and run.

9845
16:10:40,000 --> 16:10:41,210
Move.

9846
16:10:47,299 --> 16:10:49,260
They thought this was
gonna be a street fight.

9847
16:10:49,635 --> 16:10:50,761
What are you waiting for, Toretto?

9848
16:10:53,848 --> 16:10:55,015
No!

9849
16:11:09,700 --> 16:11:10,784
Letty, stop!

9850
16:11:17,100 --> 16:11:18,101
What are you gonna do?

9851
16:11:31,281 --> 16:11:35,201
I don't know why you're doing this,
but I know one thing.

9852
16:11:36,745 --> 16:11:37,787
You love me.

9853
16:11:42,459 --> 16:11:44,377
And you are not gonna shoot me.

9854
16:11:55,972 --> 16:11:59,267
You should've given him the case,
'cause I won't chase you.

9855
16:12:01,561 --> 16:12:02,771
Okay.

9856
16:12:03,480 --> 16:12:05,357
I will just take it from a dead girl.

9857
16:12:07,317 --> 16:12:08,818
You willing to die for it?

9858
16:12:27,170 --> 16:12:28,296
Let's go, then.

9859
16:12:57,900 --> 16:13:00,820
Jesus, Mum.
You're supposed to avoid the nerves.

9860
16:13:00,903 --> 16:13:02,405
Oh, shut up. Don't be such a baby.

9861
16:13:02,500 --> 16:13:04,210
Did Toretto hold up his end of the deal?

9862
16:13:04,300 --> 16:13:06,469
He gave us this little thing here.

9863
16:13:06,761 --> 16:13:08,763
No, no, no. Don't touch.

9864
16:13:09,388 --> 16:13:10,639
You can track Cipher with this,

9865
16:13:10,723 --> 16:13:13,688
but you can't do this on your own.
There's gotta be two of ya.

9866
16:13:13,768 --> 16:13:15,770
Fine. I've got contacts.

9867
16:13:16,896 --> 16:13:18,355
No, you're gonna take your brother.

9868
16:13:18,439 --> 16:13:19,648
- Oh, dear...
- Yes.

9869
16:13:19,800 --> 16:13:21,843
Toretto knows where he is.

9870
16:13:21,927 --> 16:13:23,512
He's got this thing. It can see everything.

9871
16:13:23,595 --> 16:13:25,972
It's like... It's called
the Devil's Bum Hole or something.

9872
16:13:26,056 --> 16:13:27,140
It's called the God's Eye.

9873
16:13:27,224 --> 16:13:28,308
Yeah, well, whatever.

9874
16:13:28,400 --> 16:13:30,989
There's no way I'm using Owen, all right?

9875
16:13:31,069 --> 16:13:32,779
He's a lost cause.

9876
16:13:32,862 --> 16:13:35,907
He's your brother, Decks. He's my son.

9877
16:13:36,408 --> 16:13:37,867
He's our family.

9878
16:13:38,743 --> 16:13:41,996
And our family don't die in bloody cages.

9879
16:13:42,372 --> 16:13:45,500
How can you talk like that about Owen?
I can't believe you.

9880
16:13:45,583 --> 16:13:48,673
You've gone and upset me.
You've really upset your mother.

9881
16:13:48,753 --> 16:13:50,004
Call yourself a brother? You're...

9882
16:13:50,088 --> 16:13:52,382
Look, come here... Mum. Okay, okay.

9883
16:13:54,509 --> 16:13:56,428
Every time.

9884
16:14:01,100 --> 16:14:02,101
Anything?

9885
16:14:03,102 --> 16:14:04,270
They're gone.

9886
16:14:05,688 --> 16:14:07,774
And DOD confirmed it was a nuclear football.

9887
16:14:08,107 --> 16:14:10,610
He's got an EMP and nuclear launch codes.

9888
16:14:12,070 --> 16:14:15,573
I don't know what it is,
but they're building towards something.

9889
16:14:15,990 --> 16:14:17,075
Deckard?

9890
16:14:18,618 --> 16:14:19,702
He didn't make it.

9891
16:14:44,100 --> 16:14:45,477
I'm disappointed in you, Dom.

9892
16:14:46,519 --> 16:14:49,939
When push came to shove, you were gonna
let Letty just walk away with the codes.

9893
16:14:50,023 --> 16:14:51,149
You got the codes!

9894
16:14:51,232 --> 16:14:52,775
Rhodes got the codes.

9895
16:14:53,359 --> 16:14:55,778
You made the choice to let her go.

9896
16:14:57,614 --> 16:14:59,616
And now I have to make one of my own.

9897
16:15:11,795 --> 16:15:15,465
They are adorable little things, aren't they?

9898
16:15:16,257 --> 16:15:18,051
God, I hope I don't hurt him.

9899
16:15:22,806 --> 16:15:25,475
Look, psychotic, I did exactly
what you asked me to do.

9900
16:15:26,601 --> 16:15:27,727
Don't do this.

9901
16:15:28,102 --> 16:15:29,479
This is your doing.

9902
16:15:29,813 --> 16:15:30,814
My doing?

9903
16:15:35,485 --> 16:15:36,986
Da-dada.

9904
16:15:37,153 --> 16:15:38,404
Dada.

9905
16:15:38,822 --> 16:15:40,031
Da-da.

9906
16:15:40,615 --> 16:15:42,367
Please don't hurt him, I'm begging you.

9907
16:15:42,450 --> 16:15:44,828
I don't want you to beg.

9908
16:15:47,330 --> 16:15:48,790
I want you to learn.

9909
16:15:49,165 --> 16:15:50,500
Learn what?

9910
16:15:51,793 --> 16:15:55,463
I understand why you did
what you did. I really do.

9911
16:15:58,133 --> 16:15:59,259
Da-da.

9912
16:16:02,011 --> 16:16:03,972
But it was the wrong choice.

9913
16:16:04,848 --> 16:16:07,350
This is the consequence of that.

9914
16:16:09,102 --> 16:16:10,103
No!

9915
16:16:10,270 --> 16:16:12,021
No! No!

9916
16:16:12,188 --> 16:16:13,439
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

9917
16:16:14,774 --> 16:16:16,401
Save your son!

9918
16:16:16,818 --> 16:16:17,861
No!

9919
16:16:45,054 --> 16:16:47,557
Can you pull up the footage
from the guy in the alley?

9920
16:16:48,266 --> 16:16:49,350
Traffic cams.

9921
16:16:49,517 --> 16:16:50,518
I got you.

9922
16:16:55,064 --> 16:16:56,107
I knew it.

9923
16:16:56,566 --> 16:16:57,859
I recognize that guy.

9924
16:16:58,818 --> 16:17:00,069
That's Connor Rhodes.

9925
16:17:00,487 --> 16:17:03,156
I met him when I was working
with Shaw's brother.

9926
16:17:03,239 --> 16:17:05,533
He wanted us to get
the Nightshade device for him.

9927
16:17:05,950 --> 16:17:07,160
Connor Rhodes.

9928
16:17:07,994 --> 16:17:10,375
He's also linked to somebody
I'd quite like to forget.

9929
16:17:10,455 --> 16:17:11,956
It's Mose Jakande.

9930
16:17:12,665 --> 16:17:14,626
Warlord who tried to get God's Eye.

9931
16:17:14,709 --> 16:17:17,378
Which means that's twice that Dom
has messed up Cipher's business.

9932
16:17:31,184 --> 16:17:35,688
Everything you're feeling right now,
this rage, a sense of loss, it's not real.

9933
16:17:37,190 --> 16:17:41,027
It's a survival instinct
wired deep into our brains

9934
16:17:41,110 --> 16:17:43,780
to ensure continuation of the species.

9935
16:17:44,989 --> 16:17:48,451
When early man would visit a watering hole,

9936
16:17:48,535 --> 16:17:50,453
if they didn't watch their child,

9937
16:17:50,537 --> 16:17:52,956
and it got snatched by a crocodile,

9938
16:17:53,998 --> 16:18:00,004
our brains would create
a painful but instructional memory,

9939
16:18:01,464 --> 16:18:03,216
so it would never happen again.

9940
16:18:05,468 --> 16:18:08,555
This idea of "family"
that is so core with you,

9941
16:18:08,721 --> 16:18:10,473
that rules your world,

9942
16:18:12,475 --> 16:18:14,060
it's a biological lie.

9943
16:18:15,812 --> 16:18:17,522
You don't have to accept it.

9944
16:18:19,983 --> 16:18:21,025
I don't.

9945
16:18:23,987 --> 16:18:26,990
Did you really think you
could destroy two of my teams

9946
16:18:27,073 --> 16:18:28,825
without any repercussions?

9947
16:18:30,034 --> 16:18:32,829
I wouldn't have even looked
your way if you hadn't done that.

9948
16:18:33,454 --> 16:18:35,457
You didn't even know you had a kid.

9949
16:18:36,875 --> 16:18:40,378
You can thank me for that and start
doing the job I'm asking you to do.

9950
16:18:40,545 --> 16:18:41,963
Help you start a war.

9951
16:18:42,130 --> 16:18:43,965
Is that what you think I want?

9952
16:18:46,676 --> 16:18:47,927
That's so limited.

9953
16:18:49,679 --> 16:18:51,556
I didn't take that football to start a war

9954
16:18:51,639 --> 16:18:54,350
any more than I took
your son to start a family.

9955
16:18:55,310 --> 16:18:57,187
Taking your son got me the codes.

9956
16:18:57,645 --> 16:18:59,818
The codes will get me the nukes

9957
16:18:59,898 --> 16:19:02,275
and the nukes will get me what I want

9958
16:19:02,358 --> 16:19:06,863
today, tomorrow, and every day after that.

9959
16:19:07,071 --> 16:19:08,531
And what's that?

9960
16:19:10,700 --> 16:19:11,951
Accountability.

9961
16:19:14,412 --> 16:19:16,623
The second I fire off one of those nukes,

9962
16:19:16,706 --> 16:19:20,084
I put the superpowers
of this world on notice that,

9963
16:19:20,168 --> 16:19:21,711
when they cross the line,

9964
16:19:24,214 --> 16:19:26,716
I'm gonna be there to hold them responsible.

9965
16:19:28,551 --> 16:19:30,512
Because the truth is, Dom,

9966
16:19:31,054 --> 16:19:32,597
to the world out there,

9967
16:19:35,558 --> 16:19:38,144
I am the crocodile at the watering hole.

9968
16:19:44,609 --> 16:19:46,444
We've got one last job to do.

9969
16:19:48,321 --> 16:19:49,572
Cipher.

9970
16:19:59,040 --> 16:20:00,416
If I were you, I'd kiss my son.

9971
16:20:04,337 --> 16:20:08,049
Because whether
you value it or not, all of this,

9972
16:20:08,842 --> 16:20:12,220
your plane, your security, and you,

9973
16:20:13,221 --> 16:20:15,265
are still on this earth because of him.

9974
16:20:21,104 --> 16:20:23,860
The problem we've had with tracking
Cipher is there's nothing to trace.

9975
16:20:23,940 --> 16:20:25,403
But now, we have Rhodes' information.

9976
16:20:25,483 --> 16:20:29,154
And we're getting snapshots of his data
before it's scrubbed off the net.

9977
16:20:29,237 --> 16:20:31,910
That looks like somebody's bank account,
so why don't we just go ahead...

9978
16:20:31,990 --> 16:20:33,158
It's a longitude.

9979
16:20:33,867 --> 16:20:36,119
Given the fact that Dom
hit a Russian motorcade,

9980
16:20:36,202 --> 16:20:38,454
it's safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead and bring up the map.

9981
16:20:39,747 --> 16:20:41,708
Good. Let's start here
and run the possibilities.

9982
16:20:42,459 --> 16:20:45,128
Yalta, Poltava...

9983
16:20:45,211 --> 16:20:46,629
It's like they just threw letters together.

9984
16:20:46,963 --> 16:20:48,006
Kronyurt.

9985
16:20:48,089 --> 16:20:49,299
It's "Vladovin."

9986
16:20:49,507 --> 16:20:51,050
- What are you doing here?
- What?

9987
16:20:51,217 --> 16:20:54,099
Told you I was gonna check in on you from
time to time to see how you were doin'.

9988
16:20:54,179 --> 16:20:55,638
By the way, not so hot.

9989
16:20:56,264 --> 16:20:58,850
But there's nothing in Vladovin.
It's just ice.

9990
16:20:58,933 --> 16:21:00,101
That's funny.

9991
16:21:00,393 --> 16:21:02,312
Could've sworn there was
a secret Russian naval base

9992
16:21:02,395 --> 16:21:04,314
where they retrofitted Cold War submarines.

9993
16:21:04,397 --> 16:21:06,691
Well, technically, it's not Russian anymore.

9994
16:21:07,317 --> 16:21:08,318
The base was taken over

9995
16:21:08,401 --> 16:21:10,695
by a terror group of military
separatists about a month ago,

9996
16:21:10,778 --> 16:21:12,409
and the Russians haven't taken it back yet,

9997
16:21:12,489 --> 16:21:14,741
so there is a little window
of opportunity here.

9998
16:21:14,991 --> 16:21:17,327
Russian submarines. Nuclear football.

9999
16:21:17,494 --> 16:21:20,705
It sounds like everything we do,
our legs gonna be blown off.

10000
16:21:20,872 --> 16:21:24,125
It sounds like you still
number 11 on the list.

10001
16:21:24,667 --> 16:21:26,211
It sounds like you've changed

10002
16:21:26,294 --> 16:21:28,713
since your little punk-ass
facial hairs done came in.

10003
16:21:28,838 --> 16:21:29,923
Guys, guys.

10004
16:21:30,006 --> 16:21:32,342
Hey, we gotta call this in.
All the way up the chain.

10005
16:21:32,425 --> 16:21:35,220
That's good thinking, champ,
except unfortunately,

10006
16:21:35,303 --> 16:21:37,347
the Russian Minister of Defense

10007
16:21:37,430 --> 16:21:40,183
got himself involved in a little
incident on US territory,

10008
16:21:40,266 --> 16:21:42,393
and the two governments aren't talking
to each other for a while.

10009
16:21:42,477 --> 16:21:44,103
By the time they do, it'll be too late.

10010
16:21:44,187 --> 16:21:45,980
So, any other suggestions?

10011
16:21:46,815 --> 16:21:48,858
Yeah. I got one.

10012
16:21:49,734 --> 16:21:51,569
How about we just stop them ourselves?

10013
16:21:51,653 --> 16:21:53,530
You're talking about a Russian military base.

10014
16:21:53,613 --> 16:21:54,781
Separatist.

10015
16:21:54,864 --> 16:21:55,949
Whatever. It's suicide.

10016
16:21:56,032 --> 16:21:57,492
It's stopping World War III.

10017
16:21:59,619 --> 16:22:00,703
What's it gonna be, rook?

10018
16:22:01,204 --> 16:22:03,289
You gonna close your eyes on this one, too?

10019
16:22:03,456 --> 16:22:06,417
Pray that the apocalypse doesn't come
knocking on your mama's front door?

10020
16:22:07,127 --> 16:22:09,462
Or, are you gonna saddle up, be a man,

10021
16:22:09,546 --> 16:22:12,048
and save the entire goddamn world?

10022
16:22:18,054 --> 16:22:20,515
You know, I think I figured it out.

10023
16:22:20,807 --> 16:22:21,933
What's that?

10024
16:22:22,100 --> 16:22:23,977
- Rule number three.
- Which is?

10025
16:22:25,478 --> 16:22:26,563
There are no rules.

10026
16:22:28,940 --> 16:22:32,068
What'd I tell you, Luke?
I knew he'd get it in three.

10027
16:22:32,235 --> 16:22:33,778
Aerial transport leaves in an hour.

10028
16:22:33,862 --> 16:22:36,406
Take whatever vehicle you want.
All bets are off.

10029
16:22:36,614 --> 16:22:38,324
- All bets are off?
- Bets are off?

10030
16:22:38,408 --> 16:22:39,742
Do svidaniya!

10031
16:23:05,602 --> 16:23:07,270
Letty, I don't like telling you this one bit.

10032
16:23:07,770 --> 16:23:09,230
But the game's changed.

10033
16:23:09,772 --> 16:23:12,609
Before, we were just trying to catch Dom,
but now, after all this,

10034
16:23:12,859 --> 16:23:14,611
I want you to know, if I have to,

10035
16:23:16,112 --> 16:23:17,238
I'm gonna put him down.

10036
16:23:20,283 --> 16:23:21,868
Then you might have to take us both down.

10037
16:23:23,620 --> 16:23:24,913
I'm freezing, man.

10038
16:23:25,371 --> 16:23:27,043
This ain't for me.

10039
16:23:27,123 --> 16:23:29,667
I come from a different
kind of lifestyle, brah.

10040
16:23:31,836 --> 16:23:35,298
Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with it.

10041
16:23:36,508 --> 16:23:40,470
I tried to take a piss,
I didn't even recognize myself.

10042
16:23:40,887 --> 16:23:43,139
Man, that's entirely too much information.

10043
16:23:43,306 --> 16:23:44,390
I'm just sayin'.

10044
16:23:44,557 --> 16:23:46,226
Well, one thing's for sure.

10045
16:23:47,143 --> 16:23:49,607
Dom's gotta be either working
with them or making a trade,

10046
16:23:49,687 --> 16:23:51,147
because no one would be this insane

10047
16:23:51,231 --> 16:23:52,816
to hit this place without a damn army.

10048
16:23:53,983 --> 16:23:56,152
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

10049
16:23:57,612 --> 16:23:58,822
Speak of the devil.

10050
16:24:06,830 --> 16:24:10,166
All right, Dom, you're one step
closer to that family reunion.

10051
16:24:10,333 --> 16:24:11,501
400 meters to base.

10052
16:24:11,668 --> 16:24:14,003
Prep the EMP. Let's take these defenses down.

10053
16:24:25,765 --> 16:24:27,016
We have a possible threat approaching.

10054
16:24:27,642 --> 16:24:31,062
Raise the barricade.

10055
16:24:47,537 --> 16:24:49,539
We've lost power, defensive positions now.

10056
16:24:51,667 --> 16:24:54,377
Gates are open. Let's get this party started.

10057
16:25:10,393 --> 16:25:12,020
- EMP is recharging.
- How long?

10058
16:25:12,353 --> 16:25:13,563
Sixty seconds.

10059
16:25:14,439 --> 16:25:16,983
All right, Dom, you have
one pulse left in that EMP.

10060
16:25:17,484 --> 16:25:19,110
That sub is heavily insulated.

10061
16:25:19,277 --> 16:25:21,446
You're gonna need to be right
underneath it for this thing to work.

10062
16:25:45,804 --> 16:25:47,263
Come on.

10063
16:26:04,781 --> 16:26:05,782
Yes!

10064
16:26:05,949 --> 16:26:07,450
Two birds with one stone.

10065
16:26:07,617 --> 16:26:08,952
We've got control of the sub.

10066
16:26:09,035 --> 16:26:11,704
Dom, we are good.
Head over to the rendezvous.

10067
16:26:11,788 --> 16:26:14,874
Okay, Matty, let's take this baby for a spin.

10068
16:26:20,547 --> 16:26:21,714
Damn!

10069
16:26:21,881 --> 16:26:24,467
I think Cipher just rebooted that
sub to slave its command system.

10070
16:26:24,801 --> 16:26:26,177
What the hell is he talking about?

10071
16:26:26,427 --> 16:26:29,973
In layman's terms,
she just carjacked a submarine.

10072
16:26:31,516 --> 16:26:33,101
We can't let it get away.

10073
16:26:33,852 --> 16:26:35,186
There's the control room.

10074
16:26:35,770 --> 16:26:37,689
If you can get me into that wheelhouse,

10075
16:26:37,772 --> 16:26:39,736
I can tap the network
and counter-hack Cipher.

10076
16:26:39,816 --> 16:26:41,446
Keep it from lowering into the water.

10077
16:26:41,526 --> 16:26:43,403
No, what we need to do is get me on that sub.

10078
16:26:43,653 --> 16:26:45,655
I find the weapons room
and I can pull the launch chip

10079
16:26:45,738 --> 16:26:47,157
before she can fire any of those nukes.

10080
16:26:47,323 --> 16:26:48,408
That is too crazy.

10081
16:26:48,575 --> 16:26:49,868
What you're saying is too dangerous.

10082
16:26:49,951 --> 16:26:50,994
We'll do both.

10083
16:27:15,393 --> 16:27:16,394
Knock, knock.

10084
16:27:21,483 --> 16:27:23,776
Five vehicles just breached the base.

10085
16:27:23,943 --> 16:27:25,612
They just don't give up, do they?

10086
16:27:34,662 --> 16:27:37,248
All right, let's haul ass, team.
Double time, double time!

10087
16:27:44,923 --> 16:27:46,299
Letty, let's roll!

10088
16:27:48,676 --> 16:27:50,094
Go! Go, go, go!

10089
16:28:26,339 --> 16:28:27,382
Change of plans, Dom.

10090
16:28:27,674 --> 16:28:29,759
I'm sending you new coordinates.
Head there immediately.

10091
16:28:30,135 --> 16:28:31,678
I'm done. I want my son.

10092
16:28:31,761 --> 16:28:32,929
I'll tell you when you're done.

10093
16:28:33,304 --> 16:28:34,639
Your team is in play.

10094
16:28:34,722 --> 16:28:37,100
Now, meet Rhodes and follow my instruction.

10095
16:28:42,522 --> 16:28:44,149
I've got you covered! Go!

10096
16:28:47,110 --> 16:28:49,612
Move, move! Get outta here! Go, go, go!

10097
16:28:57,537 --> 16:28:59,622
Okay. How do you like this?

10098
16:29:02,917 --> 16:29:05,503
- Remote link has been severed.
- I'll take care of this.

10099
16:29:09,424 --> 16:29:10,758
Hi, Ramsey.

10100
16:29:14,637 --> 16:29:15,889
She's regained control.

10101
16:29:16,055 --> 16:29:17,307
Damn it. She's good.

10102
16:29:58,723 --> 16:29:59,936
They're entering the weapons room.

10103
16:30:00,016 --> 16:30:01,059
Oh, that's cute.

10104
16:30:07,690 --> 16:30:08,817
Pull! Pull!

10105
16:30:09,192 --> 16:30:11,528
Roman, Roman! We gotta find the chip, go!

10106
16:30:15,073 --> 16:30:16,282
Oh, she's slick.

10107
16:30:16,533 --> 16:30:18,034
Gonna have to do better than that, though.

10108
16:30:20,119 --> 16:30:22,038
Okay, now you're starting to piss me off.

10109
16:30:37,262 --> 16:30:39,347
Ramsey, how much time we talkin' here?

10110
16:30:39,806 --> 16:30:42,851
You're smart, but not smart enough.

10111
16:30:46,354 --> 16:30:47,355
She's locked me out.

10112
16:30:51,401 --> 16:30:53,823
Tej, I can't stop her.
You're gonna have to pull that chip.

10113
16:30:53,903 --> 16:30:56,034
I can't! This thing's gone into attack mode!

10114
16:30:56,114 --> 16:30:58,241
The door's not gonna open
until you pull the chip!

10115
16:30:59,284 --> 16:31:02,078
Tej, we got no idea
what the hell we're looking for.

10116
16:31:03,454 --> 16:31:04,456
I got it!

10117
16:31:07,417 --> 16:31:09,878
What in the hell are you guys doin'?

10118
16:31:10,879 --> 16:31:12,922
It wasn't me. It wasn't me, okay?

10119
16:31:13,006 --> 16:31:14,591
It'll be labeled "Guidance Go."

10120
16:31:14,799 --> 16:31:16,634
- Guidance Go, Guidance Go...
- Okay, I got somethin'.

10121
16:31:16,718 --> 16:31:18,094
- What?
- It says...

10122
16:31:24,225 --> 16:31:25,351
Do you understand that?

10123
16:31:50,376 --> 16:31:51,836
Wow. Nasty.

10124
16:32:05,475 --> 16:32:06,810
Quite a show.

10125
16:32:09,896 --> 16:32:10,897
We're arming the nuke.

10126
16:32:13,858 --> 16:32:15,527
(POWERING UP)

10127
16:32:16,277 --> 16:32:18,738
Nuke's going hot!
She's tryin' to fire this thing!

10128
16:32:18,822 --> 16:32:20,952
Roger that. We're moving out.
(OVER RADIO) Disable the nukes!

10129
16:32:21,032 --> 16:32:22,659
Roman, what are you seeing?
Come on, talk to me.

10130
16:32:22,784 --> 16:32:24,410
I don't see shit. I'm holding on!

10131
16:32:26,287 --> 16:32:27,539
And we have a countdown.

10132
16:32:31,167 --> 16:32:32,877
What the hell is goin' on, man?

10133
16:32:32,961 --> 16:32:36,005
We're about to launch a nuclear missile,
is what the hell is goin' on!

10134
16:32:36,089 --> 16:32:37,132
Pull the damn chip!

10135
16:32:40,552 --> 16:32:42,929
Countdown, countdown! Look for a countdown!

10136
16:32:43,012 --> 16:32:44,055
What countdown?

10137
16:32:44,139 --> 16:32:45,765
The missiles need to activate to launch.

10138
16:32:45,849 --> 16:32:47,517
The countdown timer won't be in Russian.

10139
16:32:47,809 --> 16:32:48,810
The countdown...

10140
16:32:49,352 --> 16:32:51,521
Let's show the world what we've got.

10141
16:32:53,106 --> 16:32:54,357
No, no, no! Don't press that!

10142
16:32:56,860 --> 16:32:57,861
I got it.

10143
16:33:00,029 --> 16:33:01,865
Something's wrong. It won't launch.

10144
16:33:03,575 --> 16:33:06,077
Get that sub outta there. Now!

10145
16:33:08,663 --> 16:33:10,206
Move your ass, Roman!

10146
16:33:18,173 --> 16:33:19,257
You all right?

10147
16:33:19,340 --> 16:33:20,884
There's nothing all right about any of this!

10148
16:33:21,342 --> 16:33:23,261
- Let's go!
- What about the missiles?

10149
16:33:24,512 --> 16:33:26,518
We got the chip. No nukes for her.

10150
16:33:26,598 --> 16:33:28,725
Hell, yeah. Let's roll.

10151
16:33:32,854 --> 16:33:35,398
Guys, we got company. A lot of company!

10152
16:33:40,320 --> 16:33:41,488
All right, team, here's the plan.

10153
16:33:41,654 --> 16:33:43,406
There's a sea lock at the opening of the bay.

10154
16:33:43,615 --> 16:33:44,741
We get there first and close it,

10155
16:33:44,824 --> 16:33:47,744
we can stop the submarine
from escaping into open water

10156
16:33:47,869 --> 16:33:49,287
and disappearing forever.

10157
16:33:51,164 --> 16:33:53,917
I've got the location.
It's 10 miles southwest.

10158
16:33:54,167 --> 16:33:56,628
Ten miles?
We're not gonna make it ten seconds!

10159
16:34:04,135 --> 16:34:06,596
No, no, no! This is not good!

10160
16:34:07,430 --> 16:34:09,849
What's the matter, Roman?
Forgot your snow tires?

10161
16:34:10,141 --> 16:34:11,559
Whoa!

10162
16:34:11,768 --> 16:34:13,353
You lovin' that Lambo now?

10163
16:34:13,728 --> 16:34:15,563
Whoa! Ah!

10164
16:34:23,446 --> 16:34:24,781
All right, everyone.

10165
16:34:24,864 --> 16:34:26,115
We'll deal with that launch chip later.

10166
16:34:26,199 --> 16:34:28,913
Right now, I want that sub
in deep water where no one can find it.

10167
16:34:28,993 --> 16:34:30,620
Find me the fastest route out of that bay.

10168
16:34:30,703 --> 16:34:31,704
Copy that.

10169
16:34:41,381 --> 16:34:42,799
Why are they shootin' at me?

10170
16:34:42,882 --> 16:34:45,096
Maybe 'cause you're in an orange
Lamborghini, I don't know.

10171
16:34:45,176 --> 16:34:46,970
Shut up, Tej!

10172
16:34:52,308 --> 16:34:53,643
Dom...

10173
16:34:53,726 --> 16:34:55,478
Do you really wanna put that car in gear?

10174
16:34:57,063 --> 16:34:58,064
Do it.

10175
16:34:58,439 --> 16:34:59,440
Huh?

10176
16:35:02,152 --> 16:35:03,573
I didn't think so.

10177
16:35:03,653 --> 16:35:04,949
They're heading for the sea lock.

10178
16:35:05,029 --> 16:35:06,284
They're trying to trap the sub in the bay.

10179
16:35:06,364 --> 16:35:09,287
I should have taken care
of this a long time ago.

10180
16:35:09,367 --> 16:35:11,828
Rhodes, take his team out.

10181
16:35:12,662 --> 16:35:13,872
I'm on it.

10182
16:35:19,586 --> 16:35:20,837
Roman, get in front of me!

10183
16:35:27,677 --> 16:35:29,387
Okay, y'all wanna play rough?

10184
16:35:30,563 --> 16:35:32,364
Now it's my turn.

10185
16:35:46,312 --> 16:35:47,889
Yeah, baby!

10186
16:35:56,539 --> 16:35:58,833
Guys, we got snowmobiles on the right.

10187
16:36:01,002 --> 16:36:02,378
They're gonna flank us!

10188
16:36:06,549 --> 16:36:07,550
No, they ain't!

10189
16:36:13,556 --> 16:36:14,766
Oh, shit!

10190
16:36:29,155 --> 16:36:30,156
Tej!

10191
16:36:30,281 --> 16:36:32,033
Roman, hold tight, I'm on the way!

10192
16:36:36,538 --> 16:36:38,623
I don't wanna go swimmin'! No!

10193
16:36:44,712 --> 16:36:45,922
Really, Tej?

10194
16:36:49,425 --> 16:36:50,802
Oh, no, no, no!

10195
16:36:54,806 --> 16:36:55,890
Oh, shit!

10196
16:36:58,643 --> 16:36:59,856
Roman, grab your door!

10197
16:36:59,936 --> 16:37:01,020
Tej!

10198
16:37:01,271 --> 16:37:02,567
Grab the door, Roman!

10199
16:37:02,647 --> 16:37:03,648
- It's so cold!
- Shit!

10200
16:37:04,274 --> 16:37:05,275
Oh, shit!

10201
16:37:12,073 --> 16:37:13,283
Whoa!

10202
16:37:13,700 --> 16:37:14,909
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

10203
16:37:15,618 --> 16:37:17,248
What is going on?

10204
16:37:17,328 --> 16:37:18,413
Roman, hang on!

10205
16:37:19,956 --> 16:37:20,957
Tej!

10206
16:37:24,669 --> 16:37:26,254
Get me off of this thing!

10207
16:37:26,629 --> 16:37:27,964
Tej!

10208
16:37:31,468 --> 16:37:32,469
Come on!

10209
16:37:42,353 --> 16:37:43,730
Argh!

10210
16:37:47,484 --> 16:37:49,819
All right. I've had enough of this shit!

10211
16:38:04,042 --> 16:38:05,668
Number 11, my ass!

10212
16:38:08,338 --> 16:38:11,007
Yo, shrinkage! We got a sub to catch. Get in!

10213
16:38:24,854 --> 16:38:25,855
What?

10214
16:38:25,939 --> 16:38:27,190
Depressurization alert in the cargo hold.

10215
16:38:27,398 --> 16:38:29,025
Drop it to 10,000 feet.

10216
16:38:29,859 --> 16:38:32,237
I know how much these people mean to you.

10217
16:38:32,320 --> 16:38:34,405
So I will let you pick the first target.

10218
16:38:34,489 --> 16:38:36,199
I don't pick a target from a mile away.

10219
16:38:38,034 --> 16:38:40,537
I stand face to face
and look 'em dead in the eye.

10220
16:38:42,705 --> 16:38:44,082
Okay.

10221
16:38:44,365 --> 16:38:46,375
The wife it is.

10222
16:39:03,518 --> 16:39:06,479
Nice plane. I'm gonna enjoy having this.

10223
16:39:07,272 --> 16:39:08,606
Hey, don't go gettin' any ideas.

10224
16:39:08,690 --> 16:39:10,275
You and planes don't have a good history.

10225
16:39:12,777 --> 16:39:14,279
No shit.

10226
16:39:14,362 --> 16:39:17,073
Okay, let's go, Scarface.

10227
16:39:17,740 --> 16:39:19,242
These assholes ain't gonna kill themselves.

10228
16:39:22,954 --> 16:39:24,747
Pull up surveillance right now.

10229
16:39:29,878 --> 16:39:31,254
Surprise.

10230
16:39:32,881 --> 16:39:34,883
You're supposed to be dead.

10231
16:39:36,100 --> 16:39:39,604
We have a security breach in
the cargo hold. Take care of it now.

10232
16:39:47,700 --> 16:39:48,701
Get to the pilot.

10233
16:39:48,784 --> 16:39:50,453
He's got the second key. Wait for my signal.

10234
16:39:51,120 --> 16:39:52,455
Give Cipher my regards.

10235
16:40:04,000 --> 16:40:05,001
Owen.

10236
16:40:05,377 --> 16:40:06,586
In position.

10237
16:40:08,130 --> 16:40:09,131
Go.

10238
16:40:10,716 --> 16:40:12,183
I'm in.

10239
16:40:30,444 --> 16:40:31,611
I've got the package, Toretto.

10240
16:40:32,654 --> 16:40:34,322
All 12 pounds of him.

10241
16:40:34,698 --> 16:40:36,074
Ah.

10242
16:40:36,158 --> 16:40:39,494
Dada. Dada.

10243
16:40:55,177 --> 16:40:57,095
You made me miss my shot.

10244
16:40:57,179 --> 16:40:59,014
What you think you're doing?

10245
16:41:01,475 --> 16:41:02,851
Looking at you dead in the eye.

10246
16:41:26,124 --> 16:41:28,043
That was for Elena.

10247
16:41:31,713 --> 16:41:32,714
Rhodes.

10248
16:41:32,881 --> 16:41:34,549
He's no longer with us.

10249
16:41:35,550 --> 16:41:37,135
Rhodes picked the wrong target.

10250
16:41:38,512 --> 16:41:42,307
Congratulations, Dom.
You just killed your son.

10251
16:41:42,391 --> 16:41:45,227
You're wrong. I just saved him.

10252
16:41:46,019 --> 16:41:48,230
And you just took your foot
off the tiger's neck.

10253
16:41:56,738 --> 16:41:59,574
All right, governor, it's gonna get noisy.

10254
16:42:00,742 --> 16:42:02,369
This is for your ears.

10255
16:42:07,332 --> 16:42:08,333
Good?

10256
16:42:11,294 --> 16:42:12,379
Let's go.

10257
16:42:14,756 --> 16:42:17,926
No! Stop him!
Do not let him get off this plane!

10258
16:42:20,762 --> 16:42:22,305
We got another problem.

10259
16:42:22,389 --> 16:42:24,099
That truck's got
enough missiles to take us all out.

10260
16:42:24,349 --> 16:42:25,475
Then don't give 'em a target.

10261
16:42:25,559 --> 16:42:27,856
Everybody, get in front of us,
line up, and we'll take the hit.

10262
16:42:27,936 --> 16:42:30,856
What? I need to switch cars right now!

10263
16:42:47,164 --> 16:42:49,332
- Roman, here comes the bad part.
- What?

10264
16:42:56,089 --> 16:42:58,341
Hang in there, guys.
We're almost to the lock.

10265
16:42:58,425 --> 16:43:01,303
It's easy for you to say
when your ass ain't on fire.

10266
16:43:06,808 --> 16:43:10,479
All right, little man,
this might be a little scary,

10267
16:43:10,896 --> 16:43:12,314
but it's gonna be a lot of fun.

10268
16:43:23,784 --> 16:43:24,788
How's the music, good?

10269
16:43:24,868 --> 16:43:25,869
Ah.

10270
16:43:38,423 --> 16:43:39,674
They're locking on.

10271
16:43:39,758 --> 16:43:41,218
Sorry, guys, I got no tricks left.

10272
16:43:41,301 --> 16:43:42,264
What do we do now?

10273
16:43:42,344 --> 16:43:43,804
We start prayin'!

10274
16:44:06,368 --> 16:44:07,369
Hell, yeah!

10275
16:44:20,132 --> 16:44:21,383
There's Dom!

10276
16:44:25,262 --> 16:44:26,763
What, is this guy on our side now?

10277
16:44:26,847 --> 16:44:28,724
Who the hell cares? He just saved our ass!

10278
16:44:32,394 --> 16:44:34,271
Good to be riding with you again, man.

10279
16:44:47,659 --> 16:44:49,161
Toretto just cleared the way for them.

10280
16:44:49,244 --> 16:44:50,707
Someone, give me something!

10281
16:44:50,787 --> 16:44:51,830
Torpedoes are ready.

10282
16:44:51,913 --> 16:44:52,956
Then launch them!

10283
16:45:06,470 --> 16:45:07,471
Shit.

10284
16:45:11,224 --> 16:45:13,018
- Take the wheel!
- I ain't takin' shit!

10285
16:45:13,101 --> 16:45:14,519
Take the wheel!

10286
16:45:15,020 --> 16:45:16,021
Where you goin'?

10287
16:45:17,773 --> 16:45:19,027
This is crazy!

10288
16:45:19,107 --> 16:45:20,317
Speed up!

10289
16:45:23,487 --> 16:45:25,033
- Left and back!
- What?

10290
16:45:25,113 --> 16:45:27,365
Turn the goddamn wheel
to the left really quickly!

10291
16:45:34,373 --> 16:45:35,540
Boom, baby!

10292
16:45:42,381 --> 16:45:43,465
Goin' for a ride.

10293
16:45:48,970 --> 16:45:49,971
Back in a sec.

10294
16:46:05,278 --> 16:46:06,655
- Where's that smile?
- Ah.

10295
16:46:06,738 --> 16:46:07,906
There it is.

10296
16:46:13,703 --> 16:46:14,871
You were gonna shoot a baby?

10297
16:46:16,164 --> 16:46:18,291
You sick bastard.

10298
16:46:19,251 --> 16:46:20,419
You're not gonna wanna see this.

10299
16:46:33,807 --> 16:46:34,850
Is that you or him?

10300
16:46:37,811 --> 16:46:39,604
Him. Good.

10301
16:46:39,938 --> 16:46:41,231
The torpedoes missed.

10302
16:46:41,314 --> 16:46:43,066
They're gonna reach the lock
before the sub does.

10303
16:46:43,150 --> 16:46:44,359
The hell they are.

10304
16:46:47,112 --> 16:46:48,447
Get ready for this.

10305
16:47:08,717 --> 16:47:09,718
Oh, shit!

10306
16:47:09,801 --> 16:47:11,136
We're gonna need a bigger truck.

10307
16:47:22,606 --> 16:47:24,274
It's right under us! Get out the way!

10308
16:47:36,536 --> 16:47:37,621
Get us out of here!

10309
16:47:37,788 --> 16:47:39,331
Why are you always yelling?

10310
16:47:43,293 --> 16:47:44,586
This bitch is crazy!

10311
16:47:44,669 --> 16:47:46,046
Look out!

10312
16:47:52,177 --> 16:47:53,261
That's not good.

10313
16:47:54,721 --> 16:47:56,264
That's not good.

10314
16:48:00,018 --> 16:48:01,937
Please tell me there's nothing
to worry about!

10315
16:48:02,020 --> 16:48:03,438
We got this.

10316
16:48:16,076 --> 16:48:17,327
That's my girl.

10317
16:48:23,875 --> 16:48:26,548
The sub's too close.
We ain't making it to the gate in time.

10318
16:48:26,628 --> 16:48:27,838
We're just going to let it get away?

10319
16:48:28,171 --> 16:48:29,631
Not if I know Dom.

10320
16:48:34,720 --> 16:48:36,012
You lose, Dom.

10321
16:48:36,096 --> 16:48:38,432
I destroyed two of your teams.

10322
16:48:38,682 --> 16:48:40,976
I killed your red-headed boyfriend.

10323
16:48:41,059 --> 16:48:44,187
And I put two killers
on your untraceable plane.

10324
16:48:45,355 --> 16:48:48,108
You lost the minute
you interrupted my honeymoon.

10325
16:48:48,984 --> 16:48:50,819
Now guess who I'm coming for.

10326
16:48:51,403 --> 16:48:53,405
Put a heat-seeker on him now.

10327
16:48:55,407 --> 16:48:56,533
Now!

10328
16:49:01,872 --> 16:49:02,873
Fire!

10329
16:49:07,210 --> 16:49:09,463
That's a goddamn heat-seeker coming at us!

10330
16:49:12,215 --> 16:49:14,593
Peel off! Head to the shore!

10331
16:49:20,766 --> 16:49:23,518
All right. Come and get it.

10332
16:49:41,453 --> 16:49:42,579
No, no, no.

10333
16:49:44,456 --> 16:49:46,583
Dive! Dive!

10334
16:49:47,209 --> 16:49:48,418
This...

10335
16:49:48,585 --> 16:49:50,253
This is for my son.

10336
16:50:09,564 --> 16:50:10,565
Dom!

10337
16:51:13,253 --> 16:51:14,591
You're out of bullets, Deckard.

10338
16:51:14,671 --> 16:51:17,299
Not like I'm gonna need a gun
to take care of you.

10339
16:51:18,675 --> 16:51:20,177
How did you find me?

10340
16:51:23,800 --> 16:51:25,260
Resourceful.

10341
16:51:25,802 --> 16:51:27,971
You have a lot to answer for, Cipher.

10342
16:51:28,555 --> 16:51:30,390
What you've put my family through.

10343
16:51:30,807 --> 16:51:32,267
My mother.

10344
16:51:33,643 --> 16:51:36,020
I'm gonna make sure that never happens again.

10345
16:51:36,729 --> 16:51:37,814
To anyone.

10346
16:51:38,565 --> 16:51:40,904
There is only one flaw in your plan.

10347
16:51:40,984 --> 16:51:42,026
What's that?

10348
16:51:42,110 --> 16:51:44,404
Only one of us has a parachute.

10349
16:52:07,010 --> 16:52:08,511
Told you this would be fun.

10350
16:52:12,348 --> 16:52:13,683
Time to land, boys.

10351
16:52:24,277 --> 16:52:25,862
You know I never left you, Letty.

10352
16:52:25,945 --> 16:52:27,197
I know.

10353
16:52:27,614 --> 16:52:29,866
And you know I never will.

10354
16:52:31,367 --> 16:52:32,744
I know.

10355
16:52:42,712 --> 16:52:44,589
I have so much to tell you.

10356
16:52:45,256 --> 16:52:49,260
Yeah, you do.
And you can start with that bitch.

10357
16:52:53,598 --> 16:52:56,893
Now, that's Dominic Toretto.

10358
16:52:58,978 --> 16:52:59,979
Hey, Dom!

10359
16:53:00,063 --> 16:53:04,154
I'm just throwin' it out there,
we need to get up outta here

10360
16:53:04,234 --> 16:53:07,490
'cause there's all kinda nuclearism
happening under this ice.

10361
16:53:07,570 --> 16:53:10,907
Relax. Without the trigger chips,
those nukes are harmless.

10362
16:53:11,282 --> 16:53:13,034
Okay. So we good, then.

10363
16:53:13,326 --> 16:53:16,246
Let me go on and get
my young selfie levels up.

10364
16:53:16,829 --> 16:53:18,748
You realize this is classified, right?

10365
16:53:18,831 --> 16:53:20,208
Not today.

10366
16:53:22,335 --> 16:53:23,381
Unbelievable.

10367
16:53:23,461 --> 16:53:25,964
All right, can we get up
outta here, now? I'm freezin'!

10368
16:53:53,825 --> 16:53:54,993
It's okay.

10369
16:53:55,785 --> 16:53:57,912
Don't worry. He's gonna be here soon.

10370
16:53:58,288 --> 16:54:00,039
I get it. Y'all got a lot in common.

10371
16:54:00,123 --> 16:54:03,087
Computer hacks, God's Eye,
geeks, nerd... You know.

10372
16:54:03,167 --> 16:54:04,794
But we got a lot in common, too, right?

10373
16:54:04,878 --> 16:54:06,049
Like what?

10374
16:54:06,129 --> 16:54:09,507
We walk in the room
and we're oozin' sex appeal.

10375
16:54:09,591 --> 16:54:11,843
Me and you, hip to hip, is a problem.

10376
16:54:11,926 --> 16:54:14,345
I'm askin' a real question right now.

10377
16:54:14,429 --> 16:54:17,682
Is it gonna be Revenge of the Nerds

10378
16:54:18,474 --> 16:54:22,145
or The Dark Knight? Huh?

10379
16:54:22,478 --> 16:54:24,480
To be honest, I like both of you.

10380
16:54:27,609 --> 16:54:30,528
But just before we get into all of that,

10381
16:54:30,612 --> 16:54:32,405
let me ask you one question.

10382
16:54:32,488 --> 16:54:34,365
You can ask me anything.

10383
16:54:34,449 --> 16:54:35,575
Anything.

10384
16:54:35,658 --> 16:54:36,993
What's my last name?

10385
16:54:39,871 --> 16:54:43,294
When you guys figure it out,
then, I guess you can let me know.

10386
16:54:43,374 --> 16:54:46,044
It's gonna be Parker.
That's all that really matters.

10387
16:54:46,127 --> 16:54:47,462
- Jones.
- Mrs. Parker.

10388
16:54:47,879 --> 16:54:49,839
- Right?
- Hey, Mrs. Parker...

10389
16:54:50,381 --> 16:54:51,382
Hey.

10390
16:54:51,466 --> 16:54:52,759
Letty.

10391
16:54:52,842 --> 16:54:54,344
I wanted to thank you.

10392
16:54:54,886 --> 16:54:55,887
No need.

10393
16:54:57,138 --> 16:54:58,139
Well...

10394
16:54:58,473 --> 16:55:01,146
Cipher's still on the loose.
There's been some reports she's in Athens,

10395
16:55:01,226 --> 16:55:03,648
but she won't be nuking
any cities anytime soon.

10396
16:55:03,728 --> 16:55:04,938
Thanks to you guys.

10397
16:55:05,021 --> 16:55:07,148
So, I got you a party favor.

10398
16:55:07,390 --> 16:55:08,775
This can't be good.

10399
16:55:08,858 --> 16:55:11,361
Your record's been cleared.
Full reinstatement.

10400
16:55:11,444 --> 16:55:12,991
You've got your job back.

10401
16:55:13,071 --> 16:55:14,572
That is, if you want it.

10402
16:55:17,992 --> 16:55:19,122
If I want?

10403
16:55:19,202 --> 16:55:20,203
Mmm-hmm.

10404
16:55:26,709 --> 16:55:30,880
You know, after 16 years,
I figure it's time for a little break.

10405
16:55:31,506 --> 16:55:32,674
Wow.

10406
16:55:34,259 --> 16:55:36,219
Daddy's stayin' home.

10407
16:55:42,725 --> 16:55:43,768
Nobody.

10408
16:55:43,851 --> 16:55:44,894
Keep in touch.

10409
16:55:45,353 --> 16:55:46,938
Ah. Hang on a second.

10410
16:55:47,272 --> 16:55:49,440
This could be interesting.

10411
16:55:54,562 --> 16:55:55,730
What made you think I'd do it?

10412
16:55:56,739 --> 16:55:57,994
Brotherhood.

10413
16:55:58,074 --> 16:56:01,703
I saw that look you gave Cipher,
knew you wanted revenge.

10414
16:56:02,036 --> 16:56:03,538
Glad I did it.

10415
16:56:06,875 --> 16:56:09,377
I can't believe you went to see my mother.

10416
16:56:24,684 --> 16:56:26,686
All this fuss over you.

10417
16:56:32,692 --> 16:56:34,110
Yes.

10418
16:56:39,199 --> 16:56:42,285
Elena, I promised to keep our son safe.

10419
16:56:44,454 --> 16:56:46,623
And now, he always will be.

10420
16:56:54,756 --> 16:56:59,052
I wanna introduce you to the most
important person in my universe.

10421
16:57:00,720 --> 16:57:03,139
One who never gave up on me.

10422
16:57:08,811 --> 16:57:09,896
He's beautiful.

10423
16:57:11,648 --> 16:57:15,985
You've heard me say that you
never turn your back on family,

10424
16:57:17,946 --> 16:57:21,991
and I wanna thank you all
for never turning your back on me.

10425
16:57:26,579 --> 16:57:28,164
You wanna meet them?

10426
16:57:28,831 --> 16:57:30,333
All right.

10427
16:57:31,167 --> 16:57:32,502
Everyone,

10428
16:57:33,836 --> 16:57:35,255
meet Brian.

10429
16:57:44,514 --> 16:57:45,765
To Brian!

10430
16:57:45,848 --> 16:57:47,725
Welcome to the family, Brian.

10431
16:57:47,809 --> 16:57:50,520
Okay, I guess it's my turn to say grace.

10432
16:57:50,979 --> 16:57:53,485
We thank you for giving us family.

10433
16:57:53,565 --> 16:57:57,944
We sit here in praise.
Thank you for giving us the strength...

10434
16:58:36,200 --> 16:58:39,192
All right, touchdown in two.
Rules of engagement.

10435
16:58:39,244 --> 16:58:41,030
Electric rounds only.

10436
16:58:41,079 --> 16:58:43,445
MI6 wants them alive for questioning.

10437
16:58:43,499 --> 16:58:45,239
The target's in a metal coffer.

10438
16:58:45,292 --> 16:58:47,749
Every agency and terror cell
is looking for it.

10439
16:59:20,118 --> 16:59:21,278
Freeze! Down on the ground!

10440
16:59:21,328 --> 16:59:23,944
-Drop it! Drop your weapon!

10441
16:59:23,997 --> 16:59:26,579
Don't move! All of you, get down!

10442
17:00:01,451 --> 17:00:02,531
Asset secured.

10443
17:00:05,873 --> 17:00:07,784
Ml6.

10444
17:00:07,833 --> 17:00:09,198
Freeze!

10445
17:00:09,251 --> 17:00:11,617
Whoa, whoa. I'm a fan.

10446
17:00:11,670 --> 17:00:15,504
Fantastic job, and I think you look
amazing in your matching outfits.

10447
17:00:15,924 --> 17:00:17,255
Who the hell are you?

10448
17:00:17,676 --> 17:00:18,711
Bad guy.

10449
17:00:19,845 --> 17:00:21,676
Get on the ground now!

10450
17:00:28,437 --> 17:00:29,472
Nah.

10451
17:02:05,951 --> 17:02:07,782
Bulldog Two.

10452
17:02:07,828 --> 17:02:09,443
The team is down.

10453
17:02:09,496 --> 17:02:10,952
We've been betrayed.

10454
17:02:10,998 --> 17:02:13,785
She took the virus.

10455
17:02:25,679 --> 17:02:27,795
One of the soldiers
got away with the virus.

10456
17:02:27,848 --> 17:02:30,555
I want her on the run
with no place to turn.

10457
17:02:34,896 --> 17:02:37,353
She is a wily one.

10458
17:02:37,399 --> 17:02:39,890
Monitor all channels
and make sure she takes the fall for it.

10459
17:02:40,444 --> 17:02:42,025
-Understand?
-Yes, sir.

10460
17:02:42,070 --> 17:02:44,402
What you want us to do
with these assholes?

10461
17:02:44,448 --> 17:02:47,611
Clean it up. I don't care. No witnesses.

10462
17:02:47,659 --> 17:02:48,694
I'm gonna get it back.

10463
17:02:50,787 --> 17:02:52,072
Who's gonna stop me?

10464
17:03:40,462 --> 17:03:41,668
-Where?
-Where?

10465
17:04:38,103 --> 17:04:39,468
Who the hell are you?

10466
17:04:39,604 --> 17:04:44,189
Ooh. I'm what you call
"an ice-cold can of whup-ass."

10467
17:04:54,494 --> 17:04:55,859
Who the hell are you?

10468
17:04:56,288 --> 17:04:58,779
I'm what you might call
"a champagne problem."

10469
17:05:11,595 --> 17:05:12,710
What you got, big man?

10470
17:05:37,370 --> 17:05:39,110
Really thought that would have broke.

10471
17:05:44,502 --> 17:05:45,787
Uh-uh.

10472
17:05:50,091 --> 17:05:51,331
I'm gonna kill you!

10473
17:05:51,760 --> 17:05:54,251
You gonna die!

10474
17:05:58,225 --> 17:06:01,262
Ooh.

10475
17:06:09,694 --> 17:06:12,857
All right, all right. No, no.
That's my favorite jacket. Don't do that.

10476
17:06:13,323 --> 17:06:15,655
Hi, sweetheart.
Could you pass me that gun, please?

10477
17:06:16,201 --> 17:06:18,408
Thank you very much. Nice tats.

10478
17:06:19,412 --> 17:06:22,028
All right, ass-clown. We're gonna play
a little game. It's called hangman.

10479
17:06:22,082 --> 17:06:23,322
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

10480
17:06:23,375 --> 17:06:24,956
When you give me an answer I don't like...

10481
17:06:26,670 --> 17:06:28,535
Okay, you get the idea.

10482
17:06:28,588 --> 17:06:31,045
I've been tracking some
dark web chatter about a super virus

10483
17:06:31,091 --> 17:06:34,379
that's coming up on the auction block.
Why don't you tell me about it?

10484
17:06:34,427 --> 17:06:36,258
I swear, I don't know.

10485
17:06:36,304 --> 17:06:37,840
I don't like that answer.

10486
17:06:40,267 --> 17:06:42,428
A little bird told me
about a shadow outfit.

10487
17:06:42,477 --> 17:06:44,843
Black tech. Blood ops.

10488
17:06:44,896 --> 17:06:47,353
Real assholes. Like you.

10489
17:06:47,399 --> 17:06:48,855
They're called Eteon.

10490
17:06:48,900 --> 17:06:50,686
And you're gonna tell me
where to find them.

10491
17:06:50,735 --> 17:06:52,942
You're not gonna tell me
because I'm hanging you out of a window.

10492
17:06:53,321 --> 17:06:56,484
You're gonna tell me because
I'm the guy willing to drop you.

10493
17:07:03,915 --> 17:07:05,496
All right, bonus round.

10494
17:07:06,126 --> 17:07:07,366
Where's the virus?

10495
17:07:07,419 --> 17:07:08,750
No! No, wait!

10496
17:07:09,212 --> 17:07:11,624
Don't leave me out here! Please!

10497
17:07:11,673 --> 17:07:14,210
Don't leave me! Don't leave me!

10498
17:07:18,263 --> 17:07:19,673
What did he write?

10499
17:07:31,000 --> 17:07:34,663
"A, A, A." Excellent.

10500
17:07:34,712 --> 17:07:38,000
Oh, by the way, your Old Man and the Sea
report from last week?

10501
17:07:38,049 --> 17:07:39,755
You did so good, it was awesome.

10502
17:07:39,801 --> 17:07:42,588
-Thanks, Daddy.
-Give me some. Yes. Yeah. What's that?

10503
17:07:42,637 --> 17:07:46,505
Um... It's a social studies assignment.

10504
17:07:47,058 --> 17:07:48,389
It's a family tree.

10505
17:07:49,185 --> 17:07:50,766
It's just a sketch.

10506
17:07:51,187 --> 17:07:55,180
Oh, yeah.
That's our family tree right there.

10507
17:07:56,401 --> 17:08:00,144
It's super easy to read and very clear.

10508
17:08:02,282 --> 17:08:03,362
Yeah.

10509
17:08:03,408 --> 17:08:06,946
But I was going to use this.

10510
17:08:08,496 --> 17:08:10,487
I found it in a garage drawer.

10511
17:08:11,708 --> 17:08:13,118
That's you, isn't it?

10512
17:08:14,794 --> 17:08:16,159
Who's Jonah?

10513
17:08:17,005 --> 17:08:18,916
Is that your brother?

10514
17:08:20,508 --> 17:08:22,294
Yup. That's my brother.

10515
17:08:22,343 --> 17:08:24,675
Why don't you ever talk about Samoa?

10516
17:08:25,805 --> 17:08:27,136
Did something happen?

10517
17:08:27,640 --> 17:08:29,426
In life, things happen.

10518
17:08:30,226 --> 17:08:33,343
You may not want them to, but they do.

10519
17:08:35,398 --> 17:08:37,434
You just gotta do your best...

10520
17:08:39,110 --> 17:08:40,441
and move on.

10521
17:08:40,486 --> 17:08:43,694
And the fact of the matter is
I'm your family.

10522
17:08:43,740 --> 17:08:46,322
I'm your people. Me.

10523
17:08:46,367 --> 17:08:48,733
-And you're a whole lot.
-Oh, I am a whole lot.

10524
17:08:48,786 --> 17:08:51,152
Look at this. Perfect timing.

10525
17:08:53,166 --> 17:08:54,576
Oh, no, this is the mini.

10526
17:08:54,626 --> 17:08:57,288
-Yup.
-Thank you so much.

10527
17:08:57,337 --> 17:09:00,500
-Cheat day?
-Cheat day. Yeah.

10528
17:09:00,548 --> 17:09:01,708
Thank you so much.

10529
17:09:05,428 --> 17:09:06,634
Is that really necessary?

10530
17:09:06,679 --> 17:09:09,762
Come on! She's 71 years old.
What's the matter with you lot?

10531
17:09:09,807 --> 17:09:12,844
Sir, the prisoner will
only be allowed more leniency

10532
17:09:12,894 --> 17:09:15,260
when she proves
to be less of a security risk.

10533
17:09:15,313 --> 17:09:18,430
If someone leaves a back door open,
it's a bit daft not to try and use it.

10534
17:09:18,483 --> 17:09:20,974
What's daft is paying
one of the screws to leave it open

10535
17:09:21,027 --> 17:09:22,733
but not paying them enough
to keep their mouth shut.

10536
17:09:22,779 --> 17:09:24,940
Yeah, well, my point still stands.

10537
17:09:24,989 --> 17:09:27,321
If you can't break out
of a shitty prison like this,

10538
17:09:27,367 --> 17:09:28,857
then you're seriously slipping, Mum.

10539
17:09:28,910 --> 17:09:30,446
You cheeky bugger.

10540
17:09:30,495 --> 17:09:32,702
Speaking of breaking out,
where's my birthday cake?

10541
17:09:32,747 --> 17:09:35,284
The one with the ﬁle in it?
They're baking it.

10542
17:09:35,333 --> 17:09:38,166
Who wants a bloody ﬁle?
What I want is a nice little bit of C-4.

10543
17:09:38,211 --> 17:09:42,796
Listen, if you want out of here,
just say the word. I'll handle it.

10544
17:09:42,840 --> 17:09:44,705
Oh, Decks,
I'm just having a bit of fun really.

10545
17:09:44,759 --> 17:09:48,422
Being banged up doesn't bother me.
I quite enjoy the peace and quiet.

10546
17:09:48,471 --> 17:09:51,838
You know, nice walk,
bit of reading, loads of sudoku.

10547
17:09:51,891 --> 17:09:54,132
It's like being retired. Love it.

10548
17:09:54,894 --> 17:09:58,386
Now listen,
have you spoken with your sister?

10549
17:09:58,439 --> 17:09:59,895
You know I haven't, Mum.

10550
17:09:59,941 --> 17:10:01,351
-Give me your hand.
-There she goes.

10551
17:10:01,401 --> 17:10:04,438
I mean, you and your sister,
you used to be inseparable.

10552
17:10:04,487 --> 17:10:06,853
What happened, Decks?
What happened between you?

10553
17:10:06,906 --> 17:10:10,819
I remember you, Owen, and Hattie
playing out in the backyard.

10554
17:10:10,868 --> 17:10:14,827
Your little games, your little grifts.
Robbing banks.

10555
17:10:14,872 --> 17:10:16,863
You used to give
your little scams code names.

10556
17:10:16,916 --> 17:10:17,951
Do you remember?

10557
17:10:18,000 --> 17:10:20,332
-Oh, what was that one?
-The "Keith Moon."

10558
17:10:21,504 --> 17:10:24,462
Yeah, that’s right. It was
called the "Keith Moon" because it--

10559
17:10:24,507 --> 17:10:28,091
It involved lots of explosive percussion
and permanent ear damage.

10560
17:10:30,400 --> 17:10:31,435
That's my boy.

10561
17:10:31,484 --> 17:10:33,600
No wonder we left the family business.

10562
17:10:33,653 --> 17:10:34,938
She loves you, you know?

10563
17:10:34,987 --> 17:10:37,854
All you gotta do
is pick up the phone, Decks.

10564
17:10:37,907 --> 17:10:40,649
Look at me. You're her big brother.

10565
17:10:41,452 --> 17:10:42,658
She looks up to you.

10566
17:10:42,703 --> 17:10:44,034
Used to.

10567
17:10:47,375 --> 17:10:52,119
Well, one day, I just hope
that I walk through that door

10568
17:10:52,171 --> 17:10:54,127
and | see the two of you sitting there.

10569
17:10:54,173 --> 17:10:55,709
How many years you got left?

10570
17:10:56,175 --> 17:10:57,711
Two, with good behavior.

10571
17:10:57,760 --> 17:10:59,876
-So how many, really?
-Four.

10572
17:11:02,181 --> 17:11:04,046
Well, you know what they say.

10573
17:11:04,642 --> 17:11:05,848
"Never say 'never.'"

10574
17:11:06,811 --> 17:11:08,096
Time's up.

10575
17:11:08,604 --> 17:11:09,719
You behave yourself.

10576
17:11:10,148 --> 17:11:11,934
Will do. Love you, darling.

10577
17:11:11,983 --> 17:11:13,314
Love you too.

10578
17:11:27,498 --> 17:11:30,956
-All right.
-Lucas Rebecca Hobbs.

10579
17:11:31,002 --> 17:11:33,539
I haven't seen you in forever.

10580
17:11:33,588 --> 17:11:36,125
-"Rebecca?"
-Do you even age? How long's it been?

10581
17:11:37,049 --> 17:11:38,380
-Six months.
-Time ﬂies.

10582
17:11:38,426 --> 17:11:41,088
-When we're apart.
-What is your skin care regimen?

10583
17:11:41,137 --> 17:11:44,004
Because you look
like a young Shirley Temple.

10584
17:11:44,056 --> 17:11:46,422
-Go, go, go, go, go.
-Daddy, who is this guy?

10585
17:11:46,476 --> 17:11:49,388
Well, this guy is Locke.

10586
17:11:50,271 --> 17:11:52,478
And he works for the CIA.

10587
17:11:52,523 --> 17:11:54,354
-Your dad and I are old friends.
-We're not old friends.

10588
17:11:54,400 --> 17:11:55,480
Actually, we're...

10589
17:11:56,360 --> 17:11:57,725
We're best friends. Here's the half heart.

10590
17:11:57,778 --> 17:11:59,109
I don't know what that is.

10591
17:11:59,155 --> 17:12:01,271
-We got some ink together as well.
-We did not get ink together.

10592
17:12:01,324 --> 17:12:02,939
-Oh, we didn't?
-No, we did not.

10593
17:12:02,992 --> 17:12:05,028
-Interesting. I seem to remember...
-We never got ink together.

10594
17:12:05,077 --> 17:12:08,945
...getting a little something like this
at one point on my body.

10595
17:12:08,998 --> 17:12:11,114
-Jesus.
-Christ, I miss our playful banter.

10596
17:12:11,167 --> 17:12:12,782
You have one minute
to tell me what you want

10597
17:12:12,835 --> 17:12:14,200
before I knock one of your lungs loose.

10598
17:12:14,253 --> 17:12:16,039
You and I are after the same thing.

10599
17:12:16,088 --> 17:12:18,170
Say hello to the CT-17 virus.

10600
17:12:18,216 --> 17:12:21,333
It's a programmable bioweapon
of biblical proportions.

10601
17:12:21,385 --> 17:12:23,876
Affectionately code-named "the Snowflake."

10602
17:12:23,930 --> 17:12:25,090
What does the Snowflake do?

10603
17:12:25,139 --> 17:12:28,006
Oh, nothing much.
Just liquefies your internal organs.

10604
17:12:28,059 --> 17:12:30,846
Basically turns your body
into a giant bag of hot soup.

10605
17:12:30,895 --> 17:12:32,101
She is nine!

10606
17:12:32,146 --> 17:12:33,602
-Seen worse.
-Where?

10607
17:12:33,648 --> 17:12:35,058
Game of Thrones. Janet's house.

10608
17:12:35,107 --> 17:12:37,063
-I've never heard of it.
-A Lannister always pays his debts.

10609
17:12:37,109 --> 17:12:38,940
You're never going over there again.

10610
17:12:38,986 --> 17:12:41,068
But there's a new
wrinkle in the case, Rebecca.

10611
17:12:41,113 --> 17:12:44,901
The specifics... are all in the brief.

10612
17:12:44,951 --> 17:12:46,282
There you go.

10613
17:12:46,619 --> 17:12:48,701
-She's ready, Becca.
-She's nine.

10614
17:12:48,746 --> 17:12:51,829
This is the only unit of CT-17
in existence,

10615
17:12:51,874 --> 17:12:56,459
and this Snowﬂake is now in the hands
of a rogue MI6 operative in London.

10616
17:12:56,504 --> 17:12:58,040
Dad, are all spies that pretty?

10617
17:12:59,757 --> 17:13:01,668
No. She is unusually attractive.

10618
17:13:01,717 --> 17:13:03,207
And deadly.

10619
17:13:03,261 --> 17:13:06,344
Last night she was part of an MI6 team
tasked with securing the virus.

10620
17:13:06,389 --> 17:13:09,005
She then proceeded to kill
her entire black ops squad.

10621
17:13:09,058 --> 17:13:12,550
She stabbed one guy in the chest
using a brick.

10622
17:13:12,603 --> 17:13:14,139
Do you know how hard that is?

10623
17:13:14,188 --> 17:13:15,974
To stab someone using a brick?

10624
17:13:16,023 --> 17:13:18,230
-Get to the point.
-The point is there's no sharp edge.

10625
17:13:18,276 --> 17:13:20,858
How did she get an entire brick
into another person's chest?

10626
17:13:20,903 --> 17:13:22,439
She either had to be really strong

10627
17:13:22,488 --> 17:13:25,901
or the other person had to have been,
like, born without, like, bones.

10628
17:13:25,950 --> 17:13:28,532
-Get to the larger point.
-She stole the Snowflake.

10629
17:13:28,578 --> 17:13:30,660
-She went totally off-grid.
-Who's this?

10630
17:13:30,705 --> 17:13:32,696
That's the scientist
we believe created the virus.

10631
17:13:32,748 --> 17:13:34,534
Great. Where do I find him?

10632
17:13:34,584 --> 17:13:37,121
He's off-grid too.
Impossible to ﬁnd. Maybe dead.

10633
17:13:37,169 --> 17:13:40,206
-You're very helpful, Locke.
-And you're the world's best tracker.

10634
17:13:40,256 --> 17:13:41,996
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

10635
17:13:42,049 --> 17:13:45,382
Oh, no, no, no. I'm DSS, you're CIA.
I don't work for you.

10636
17:13:45,428 --> 17:13:48,044
Your boss loaned you out.
You do now, dickface.

10637
17:13:48,097 --> 17:13:49,382
-What'd you just call me?
-Hey, hey, hey!

10638
17:13:49,432 --> 17:13:50,922
Let's just settle down. All right?

10639
17:13:50,975 --> 17:13:52,715
We've already got
a black site running in London.

10640
17:13:52,768 --> 17:13:55,475
There's an operative there.
Top of his game. He'll be your contact.

10641
17:13:55,521 --> 17:13:57,182
I don't need anybody else. I work alone.

10642
17:13:57,231 --> 17:13:59,392
We got bigger problems
than your fragile ego,

10643
17:13:59,442 --> 17:14:02,434
or the fact that a moment ago
I most deﬁnitely shit my pants.

10644
17:14:04,155 --> 17:14:06,487
The entire world
is at stake here, all right?

10645
17:14:06,532 --> 17:14:09,148
This thing gets out, we're looking at
a lot of liqueﬁed organs,

10646
17:14:09,201 --> 17:14:11,157
and I mean, like, everywhere.

10647
17:14:11,203 --> 17:14:13,159
And not just yours and mine.

10648
17:14:14,332 --> 17:14:17,039
Uh... He knows I can see him, right?

10649
17:14:19,337 --> 17:14:20,952
He knows nothing, Jon Snow.

10650
17:14:23,507 --> 17:14:24,963
So what's it gonna be, Becky?

10651
17:14:25,009 --> 17:14:26,374
You gonna partner up?

10652
17:14:28,304 --> 17:14:29,714
-I'm in.
-Of course you are.

10653
17:14:29,764 --> 17:14:31,095
Do you remember what I told you in Rwanda?

10654
17:14:33,059 --> 17:14:34,924
-"Stop watching me sleep."
-I said:

10655
17:14:35,478 --> 17:14:38,265
-"We are not friends at all."
-We're best friends.

10656
17:14:38,314 --> 17:14:40,305
-And to watch your back.
-Wash your back, yeah.

10657
17:14:40,358 --> 17:14:41,894
-Oh, I remember.
-Watch your back.

10658
17:14:41,942 --> 17:14:43,273
Lot of back. I got you.

10659
17:14:43,319 --> 17:14:45,651
Hey. Same old Hobbs, huh?

10660
17:14:45,696 --> 17:14:46,776
Same old Locke.

10661
17:14:48,783 --> 17:14:50,523
All right. Who's on the case?

10662
17:14:58,584 --> 17:15:00,996
-Mr. Shaw.
-Whatever it is, I ain't buying it.

10663
17:15:01,045 --> 17:15:02,876
You don't know what I'm selling,
or who I am.

10664
17:15:02,922 --> 17:15:03,957
CIA.

10665
17:15:04,006 --> 17:15:07,749
-How could you--
-Sunglasses, cloudy day, sensible shoes.

10666
17:15:08,344 --> 17:15:11,507
I have fallen arches, and I don't have
a lot of choice in what I--

10667
17:15:11,555 --> 17:15:13,921
Anyway, I'm Agent Loeb, and I need
to talk to you about our shared interest.

10668
17:15:13,974 --> 17:15:15,009
How'd you find me?

10669
17:15:15,059 --> 17:15:18,096
I got a tip from an acquaintance of yours:
Mr. Nobody.

10670
17:15:18,145 --> 17:15:19,260
Mr. Nobody.

10671
17:15:20,022 --> 17:15:21,432
Little joke for you, Loeb.

10672
17:15:21,982 --> 17:15:25,395
What do CIA operatives
and baseballs have in common?

10673
17:15:25,444 --> 17:15:27,730
People cheer when you hit them with a bat.

10674
17:15:27,780 --> 17:15:28,815
No.

10675
17:15:29,240 --> 17:15:32,152
They are two things
I don't give a toss about.

10676
17:15:33,536 --> 17:15:34,696
That works too.

10677
17:15:40,459 --> 17:15:43,246
The weapon she's stolen
is not like anything we've ever seen.

10678
17:15:43,295 --> 17:15:46,662
It's a programmable disease
that can target any DNA sequence

10679
17:15:46,716 --> 17:15:49,833
with a 100% mortality rate
inside 72 hours.

10680
17:15:49,885 --> 17:15:53,173
If MI6 ﬁnds her,
they’re gonna treat her like a traitor.

10681
17:15:53,222 --> 17:15:55,429
We need you to surrender the virus.

10682
17:15:56,517 --> 17:15:57,848
What is your location?

10683
17:16:00,312 --> 17:16:01,802
What, you think I killed them?

10684
17:16:01,856 --> 17:16:04,814
But if you help us ﬁnd her,
if you bring us the virus,

10685
17:16:05,192 --> 17:16:06,773
we'll grant her immunity.

10686
17:16:10,489 --> 17:16:12,445
We've set up a black site here in London.

10687
17:16:12,491 --> 17:16:14,573
You've got everything you could need
at your disposal,

10688
17:16:14,618 --> 17:16:17,234
and we're bringing in an asset
from the States to assist you.

10689
17:16:17,288 --> 17:16:18,698
I don't need anybody.

10690
17:16:18,748 --> 17:16:20,329
Maybe not, Mr. Shaw.

10691
17:16:21,000 --> 17:16:22,035
But she does.

10692
17:16:26,547 --> 17:16:28,583
-My guy's in.
-My guy's in too.

10693
17:16:29,049 --> 17:16:31,256
Is your guy gonna freak out
when he ﬁnds out who my guy is?

10694
17:16:31,302 --> 17:16:33,167
Didn't they just do a job
together in New York?

10695
17:16:33,220 --> 17:16:35,336
Didn't they just destroy
the DSS field office in LA

10696
17:16:35,389 --> 17:16:36,970
by throwing each other through it?

10697
17:16:37,016 --> 17:16:39,758
I don't know. Look,
I don't know about your guy, but my guy?

10698
17:16:39,810 --> 17:16:42,051
He's gonna get this.
He's gonna pull this off. You know why?

10699
17:16:42,104 --> 17:16:44,595
We've been best friends
our whole goddamn lives.

10700
17:16:44,648 --> 17:16:48,561
Well, my guy beat the shit out of me
at a bar in Krakow 17 years ago,

10701
17:16:48,611 --> 17:16:50,272
and he doesn't even remember me.

10702
17:16:50,321 --> 17:16:52,778
So we all have our histories.

10703
17:16:52,823 --> 17:16:54,563
Anyway, it's the fate of the world here.

10704
17:16:54,617 --> 17:16:55,697
It's the fate of the world.

10705
17:16:55,743 --> 17:16:57,825
The planet's population is in their hands.

10706
17:16:57,870 --> 17:16:58,985
Serious stuff.

10707
17:16:59,038 --> 17:17:02,155
You'd think they'd be able to put aside
any petty rivalries to save the world.

10708
17:17:02,208 --> 17:17:03,368
Mm. Mm.

10709
17:17:03,751 --> 17:17:05,457
-No fucking way.
-No fucking way.

10710
17:17:05,503 --> 17:17:07,960
I'm not working with this guy.
I've been there, done that.

10711
17:17:08,005 --> 17:17:10,792
The minute he gets involved,
you can kiss goodbye to any ﬁnesse,

10712
17:17:10,841 --> 17:17:13,253
because She-Hulk here
only knows how to smash.

10713
17:17:13,302 --> 17:17:15,793
And Mr. Arson here
only knows how to blow shit up.

10714
17:17:15,846 --> 17:17:17,177
-The fact is...
-And the fact is...

10715
17:17:17,223 --> 17:17:18,884
-no offense...
-oh, no offense...

10716
17:17:18,933 --> 17:17:20,969
-this guy's a real asshole.
-this guy's a real asshole.

10717
17:17:22,269 --> 17:17:25,136
That's "sumbitch" in your native tongue.

10718
17:17:25,189 --> 17:17:27,430
That'd be "wanker" in your native tongue.

10719
17:17:27,483 --> 17:17:30,441
Are you ﬁnished blubbering?
You sound like a giant tattooed baby.

10720
17:17:30,486 --> 17:17:33,228
I'm not listening to this horseshit.
I got a job to do.

10721
17:17:33,989 --> 17:17:37,732
Tell your mom I said hi.
Actually, I'll tell her myself.

10722
17:17:37,785 --> 17:17:40,697
Don't you ever talk about my mother.
I'll put your head through that wall.

10723
17:17:40,746 --> 17:17:44,489
Secondly, I'll have this job done while
you're still putting on your baby oil.

10724
17:17:44,542 --> 17:17:45,657
Good luck, slick.

10725
17:17:45,709 --> 17:17:48,667
That's it. You just reminded me.

10726
17:17:48,712 --> 17:17:51,749
That's exactly why
I hate working with you.

10727
17:17:52,383 --> 17:17:53,748
It's your voice.

10728
17:17:54,593 --> 17:17:58,211
It's your nasally, prepubescent,
Harry Potter voice.

10729
17:17:58,264 --> 17:18:01,347
Every time you speak,
just imagine this for a second,

10730
17:18:01,392 --> 17:18:05,510
it's like dragging my balls
across shattered glass.

10731
17:18:06,814 --> 17:18:08,679
-And it hurts.
-Well, for me,

10732
17:18:09,525 --> 17:18:10,765
it's not your voice.

10733
17:18:11,610 --> 17:18:12,690
It's your face.

10734
17:18:12,736 --> 17:18:15,227
Your big, stupid face.

10735
17:18:15,281 --> 17:18:16,942
Looking at it makes me feel

10736
17:18:16,991 --> 17:18:20,859
like God is projectile vomiting
right in my eyes.

10737
17:18:21,787 --> 17:18:23,072
And it burns.

10738
17:18:24,832 --> 17:18:26,038
It really burns.

10739
17:18:28,002 --> 17:18:30,618
What you gonna do now?
Throw a bit of furniture?

10740
17:18:30,671 --> 17:18:33,333
For your information, I was gonna
take this chair and turn it sideways

10741
17:18:33,382 --> 17:18:35,623
and shove it right down your throat.

10742
17:18:35,676 --> 17:18:38,008
Of course you are,
'cause that's your answer to everything.

10743
17:18:38,053 --> 17:18:40,965
Smash a hole through every problem
in a massive truck.

10744
17:18:41,015 --> 17:18:42,926
-That's not gonna work here.
-I think it'll work fine.

10745
17:18:42,975 --> 17:18:46,342
Guys, why don't you two take a seat
and we'll talk through this?

10746
17:18:50,232 --> 17:18:52,769
Me and you? Us? I've been down this road.

10747
17:18:52,818 --> 17:18:54,274
It's a total waste of time.

10748
17:18:54,320 --> 17:18:55,776
For once, I couldn't agree with you more.

10749
17:18:55,821 --> 17:18:57,436
Yeah? Well, I'm doing this my way.

10750
17:18:58,282 --> 17:19:01,774
If anyone's got a problem with that,
I suggest you come out here and stop me.

10751
17:19:01,827 --> 17:19:03,408
I'm not going in there.

10752
17:19:03,454 --> 17:19:04,739
Well, I'm not going in there.

10753
17:19:05,289 --> 17:19:06,404
Smart lads.

10754
17:19:15,299 --> 17:19:19,508
All right, now that we got rid of
that fun sponge, we can get to work.

10755
17:19:19,553 --> 17:19:22,420
I want you to pull up every CCTV camera
around central London.

10756
17:19:22,473 --> 17:19:24,509
We already have two dozen agents
scouring footage.

10757
17:19:24,558 --> 17:19:26,844
Don't you talk back to me, Opie. Uh-uh.

10758
17:19:26,894 --> 17:19:29,601
I just care about the coverage.
I ain't gonna ask you again. Pull it up.

10759
17:19:33,442 --> 17:19:35,057
Now zoom in on the area of the heist.

10760
17:19:37,029 --> 17:19:40,897
Now invert it. Highlight the areas
that the cameras don't cover.

10761
17:19:43,619 --> 17:19:44,779
She's smart.

10762
17:19:45,871 --> 17:19:48,829
She just killed her entire team
and stole a deadly virus.

10763
17:19:50,000 --> 17:19:51,740
She ain't waiting around for no picture.

10764
17:21:22,801 --> 17:21:25,008
Got a lot of nasty people looking for you.

10765
17:21:26,764 --> 17:21:27,970
Are you nasty?

10766
17:21:28,474 --> 17:21:31,261
Well, it all depends on what happens
in the next 30 seconds.

10767
17:21:31,310 --> 17:21:33,266
Promises, promises.

10768
17:21:41,904 --> 17:21:45,522
So here's how it's gonna go down.
We do this the hard way or the easy way.

10769
17:21:45,574 --> 17:21:47,189
-Are you serious?
-I am.

10770
17:21:47,242 --> 17:21:48,448
-Really?
-Yes.

10771
17:21:48,494 --> 17:21:51,531
-Hmm. Well, it's a tough decision.
-No, it's really not.

10772
17:21:51,580 --> 17:21:52,945
You want me to freeze?

10773
17:21:54,583 --> 17:21:55,789
Let me see your hands.

10774
17:21:56,585 --> 17:21:57,620
Fine.

10775
17:21:59,797 --> 17:22:01,753
But you're not gonna like what's in 'em.

10776
17:22:03,383 --> 17:22:05,840
-Think I made up my mind.
-You seem like a smart woman.

10777
17:22:05,886 --> 17:22:06,921
I am.

10778
17:22:06,970 --> 17:22:08,210
The hard way.

10779
17:22:11,016 --> 17:22:12,426
Look-- Hold on!

10780
17:22:22,569 --> 17:22:23,729
Stop!

10781
17:22:29,576 --> 17:22:30,611
Jeez.

10782
17:22:41,505 --> 17:22:43,587
Hey! No.

10783
17:23:01,150 --> 17:23:03,141
Oh!

10784
17:23:10,701 --> 17:23:12,908
-Are you taking it easy on me?
-For the moment.

10785
17:23:39,521 --> 17:23:41,227
Bet you wish
you didn't take it easy on me now.

10786
17:23:41,273 --> 17:23:42,888
I wish a lot of things right now.

10787
17:23:52,534 --> 17:23:56,402
You're going to go to sleep now.
It's all gonna seem like a bad dream.

10788
17:23:56,455 --> 17:23:58,116
It's more like a nightmare.

10789
17:23:58,165 --> 17:23:59,951
This whole thing is a nightmare.

10790
17:24:02,169 --> 17:24:05,036
All right,
let's me and you have a little chat.

10791
17:24:28,946 --> 17:24:31,983
The director called.
He ordered a new baseline for you.

10792
17:24:32,032 --> 17:24:34,068
He has everything ready for you
in medical.

10793
17:24:36,370 --> 17:24:40,238
Perfection is a painful process, Brixton,

10794
17:24:40,249 --> 17:24:43,537
in ourselves
and in the pursuit of a perfect world.

10795
17:24:45,003 --> 17:24:48,621
Humanity must evolve
before it destroys itself.

10796
17:24:50,092 --> 17:24:53,300
Eteon will carve out all human weakness

10797
17:24:53,345 --> 17:24:55,882
and replace it with mechanical perfection.

10798
17:24:56,807 --> 17:24:58,468
And you will lead the way.

10799
17:25:02,354 --> 17:25:03,685
I'm gonna ask you a question.

10800
17:25:04,189 --> 17:25:05,554
It's not what you think it is.

10801
17:25:06,191 --> 17:25:07,306
Do you like to dance?

10802
17:25:07,734 --> 17:25:09,474
What, the Electric Slide?

10803
17:25:09,528 --> 17:25:11,894
The Macarena? No, I don't.

10804
17:25:11,947 --> 17:25:15,314
No, no, no,
I was thinking about... the tango.

10805
17:25:15,367 --> 17:25:18,109
-Where it takes two.
-Yeah, don't know that one.

10806
17:25:18,161 --> 17:25:19,617
Must be different generations.

10807
17:25:22,499 --> 17:25:26,833
Yeah, well, either way, the music started,
so let's see what kind of rhythm you have.

10808
17:25:28,380 --> 17:25:29,870
-Where's the virus?
-Look, I told you,

10809
17:25:29,923 --> 17:25:31,914
-I've no idea what you're talking about.
-Okay, that hurt.

10810
17:25:31,967 --> 17:25:34,083
You just stepped on my toes,
that didn't feel good.

10811
17:25:34,136 --> 17:25:36,092
Let's try it again.
I think you're better than that.

10812
17:25:36,138 --> 17:25:38,299
-Where's the virus?
-I didn't ask to dance.

10813
17:25:38,348 --> 17:25:40,088
And why should I talk to you?
You're not CIA.

10814
17:25:40,142 --> 17:25:41,348
No? How do you know that?

10815
17:25:41,393 --> 17:25:42,633
Where shall I start?

10816
17:25:43,186 --> 17:25:45,848
There's two types of CIA agents.
Intelligence and espionage.

10817
17:25:45,897 --> 17:25:47,683
Those guys over there
can barely lift a pencil.

10818
17:25:47,733 --> 17:25:49,269
That's what intelligence agents look like.

10819
17:25:49,318 --> 17:25:51,434
You look like you could
pick up a building.

10820
17:25:51,903 --> 17:25:54,269
But espionage is about blending in
and about being subtle,

10821
17:25:54,323 --> 17:25:58,362
and there is nothing subtle about you.

10822
17:25:58,744 --> 17:25:59,859
Yeah.

10823
17:26:00,412 --> 17:26:01,492
That's good.

10824
17:26:02,414 --> 17:26:04,200
-I'm impressed.
-I didn't kill anybody.

10825
17:26:04,249 --> 17:26:05,364
I know you didn't.

10826
17:26:07,210 --> 17:26:08,370
How do you know that, then?

10827
17:26:08,420 --> 17:26:10,752
Because you can learn a lot about somebody
when you fight them.

10828
17:26:10,797 --> 17:26:14,381
And when we fought,
you weren't fighting to kill me.

10829
17:26:14,426 --> 17:26:15,962
You were fighting to run away.

10830
17:26:16,678 --> 17:26:19,920
But either way, the world thinks that
you're a murderer and a thief,

10831
17:26:19,973 --> 17:26:22,259
so you're not going anywhere
or getting any goddamn phone call

10832
17:26:22,309 --> 17:26:23,640
until you give me some real answers.

10833
17:26:23,685 --> 17:26:25,221
You have no idea what is happening here.

10834
17:26:25,270 --> 17:26:26,806
-Then tell me. Help me understand.
-I can't.

10835
17:26:26,855 --> 17:26:28,766
-You're wasting my time.
-I can't either-- You're wasting time!

10836
17:26:28,815 --> 17:26:31,557
Virus gets in the wrong hands, that's it.
It's game over.

10837
17:26:43,413 --> 17:26:45,074
Does that mean it's time for curls?

10838
17:26:45,123 --> 17:26:47,865
Just like the CIA,
always flexing the wrong muscle.

10839
17:26:47,918 --> 17:26:49,658
You know, the mind
is the strongest muscle in the body.

10840
17:26:49,711 --> 17:26:51,667
Maybe you should try
exercising that a little bit more.

10841
17:26:52,923 --> 17:26:56,086
"There's more wisdom in your body
than in your deepest philosophies."

10842
17:26:56,134 --> 17:26:58,967
Let me guess. That Bruce Lee?

10843
17:26:59,012 --> 17:27:01,048
No, Nietzsche.

10844
17:27:01,640 --> 17:27:02,971
'Cause I'm flexing this.

10845
17:27:03,934 --> 17:27:05,094
And all of that.

10846
17:27:07,813 --> 17:27:08,893
Come here.

10847
17:27:10,190 --> 17:27:11,976
If she moves, I want you to shoot her.

10848
17:27:12,025 --> 17:27:13,060
Yeah, he can't shoot me.

10849
17:27:13,527 --> 17:27:15,358
-Yeah, not allowed.
-In the face.

10850
17:27:15,404 --> 17:27:16,610
You can't. You'd go to prison.

10851
17:27:16,655 --> 17:27:19,317
-You can shoot her right in the face.
-No, you can't. You'd go to prison. Sorry.

10852
17:27:19,366 --> 17:27:21,948
I want you to shoot her
two times right in that face.

10853
17:27:23,453 --> 17:27:24,863
-Okay?
-Yeah.

10854
17:27:31,795 --> 17:27:32,830
Hi, Dad.

10855
17:27:32,879 --> 17:27:34,335
Did you catch the hot spy lady?

10856
17:27:34,381 --> 17:27:36,622
Come on. It's me.
I catch everybody I hunt.

10857
17:27:37,008 --> 17:27:38,464
How long have you been doing this?

10858
17:27:39,553 --> 17:27:42,135
'Cause you seem... new.

10859
17:27:47,644 --> 17:27:49,054
She's actually quite annoying.

10860
17:27:49,104 --> 17:27:52,346
You know, Dad,
sometimes people annoy each other

10861
17:27:52,399 --> 17:27:54,765
when they're actually, like, ﬂirting.

10862
17:27:54,818 --> 17:27:55,978
Where'd you hear that from?

10863
17:27:59,406 --> 17:28:02,443
Okay, look, me and the spy lady,
we're not flirting, all right?

10864
17:28:02,492 --> 17:28:03,607
Zero chemistry.

10865
17:28:18,258 --> 17:28:19,589
I don't know.

10866
17:28:19,634 --> 17:28:22,501
When you saw her photo,
you definitely gave the eyebrow.

10867
17:28:22,554 --> 17:28:23,919
What eyebrow?

10868
17:28:23,972 --> 17:28:26,634
-You know, Dad, that thing that you do.
-What thing?

10869
17:28:28,018 --> 17:28:29,599
-I don't do that.
-Yes, you do.

10870
17:28:29,644 --> 17:28:32,306
No, I definitely don't do that.
I don't even know what you're doing.

10871
17:28:32,355 --> 17:28:34,391
That’s the silliest thing I've ever seen.

10872
17:28:34,441 --> 17:28:36,397
Let me get going,
I got business to take care of.

10873
17:28:36,443 --> 17:28:38,855
I'll see you when I get home, okay?
I love you.

10874
17:28:38,904 --> 17:28:40,019
Love you.

10875
17:28:40,071 --> 17:28:41,231
Hey, one more thing.

10876
17:28:45,952 --> 17:28:47,192
Goddamn it.

10877
17:28:55,629 --> 17:28:57,165
This is not the dance
you wanna do with me, woman.

10878
17:28:57,214 --> 17:28:59,421
-Oh, really?
-I eat bullets all day long.

10879
17:28:59,466 --> 17:29:02,253
Oh, for breakfast and lunch?
'Cause it's dinnertime.

10880
17:29:02,302 --> 17:29:03,712
I'll count down for you. Three...

10881
17:29:04,095 --> 17:29:05,756
-Two...
-Hobbs.

10882
17:29:05,805 --> 17:29:07,796
-Freeze.
-Put that down.

10883
17:29:07,849 --> 17:29:09,805
Get your greasy
sausage fingers off of her.

10884
17:29:09,851 --> 17:29:11,716
-What are you doing here?
-Saving you.

10885
17:29:12,479 --> 17:29:13,764
I don't need to be saved.

10886
17:29:13,813 --> 17:29:17,180
No, no. This is my house and your
goddamn girlfriend ain't going anywhere.

10887
17:29:17,234 --> 17:29:18,940
-That's disgusting.
-"Girlfriend?"

10888
17:29:18,985 --> 17:29:20,691
That is my sister.

10889
17:29:23,448 --> 17:29:25,564
Bullshit. She's too good-looking
to be your sister.

10890
17:29:25,617 --> 17:29:27,949
Very funny.
Hat, there are people after you.

10891
17:29:27,994 --> 17:29:29,074
Believe me, I know that.

10892
17:29:29,120 --> 17:29:31,327
It's gonna stay that way
unless you tell me where that virus is.

10893
17:29:31,373 --> 17:29:34,786
Listen to me, pinhead. She's gonna die
if I don't get her out of here right now!

10894
17:29:34,834 --> 17:29:37,075
We're all gonna die if
she doesn't tell us where that weapon is.

10895
17:29:37,128 --> 17:29:39,710
Actually, everyone's gonna die
'cause I am the virus!

10896
17:29:40,423 --> 17:29:41,788
It's embedded in capsules.

10897
17:29:41,841 --> 17:29:43,422
I need to find a way to get them out.

10898
17:30:10,787 --> 17:30:11,822
Bag the asset.

10899
17:30:41,735 --> 17:30:43,976
-Now or never.
-I'm more of a now type of guy.

10900
17:30:44,029 --> 17:30:45,985
-On my three.
-Sure.

10901
17:30:46,406 --> 17:30:48,692
One, two, three.

10902
17:30:50,368 --> 17:30:51,858
No one tells me what to do.

10903
17:32:14,244 --> 17:32:15,950
Now I take you to school, son.

10904
17:32:33,179 --> 17:32:36,012
Deckard Shaw. It's been a long time.

10905
17:32:36,057 --> 17:32:37,172
Good to see you, Brixton.

10906
17:32:37,225 --> 17:32:40,092
-I think you're out of bullets there, son.
-Lucky for you, I am.

10907
17:32:40,145 --> 17:32:41,385
Yeah.

10908
17:32:42,939 --> 17:32:44,554
-Nice suit.
-Bulletproof.

10909
17:32:44,607 --> 17:32:46,347
-State of the art.
-Could've done with that

10910
17:32:46,401 --> 17:32:47,686
the last time I put a bullet in ya.

10911
17:32:47,736 --> 17:32:49,226
No, actually, it was three bullets.

10912
17:32:49,279 --> 17:32:52,521
Two to the chest, one to the head.
Just like they taught us. Do you remember?

10913
17:32:52,949 --> 17:32:54,860
It's a shame you didn't join Eteon.

10914
17:32:54,909 --> 17:32:56,274
You could've had all this, my friend.

10915
17:32:56,327 --> 17:32:57,362
-"Friend?"
-Yeah.

10916
17:32:57,412 --> 17:33:01,451
-You're not the man I knew.
-No. I am way better.

10917
17:33:01,875 --> 17:33:03,866
I'm the future of mankind.

10918
17:33:30,445 --> 17:33:31,776
Stop!

10919
17:33:31,821 --> 17:33:33,061
Stop!

10920
17:33:35,158 --> 17:33:37,023
Hattie, get in the car.

10921
17:33:37,076 --> 17:33:38,361
We're all going.

10922
17:33:39,245 --> 17:33:40,325
Not you.

10923
17:33:40,789 --> 17:33:41,824
Just the girl.

10924
17:33:42,499 --> 17:33:45,081
I said, we're all going.

10925
17:33:53,551 --> 17:33:55,837
Disable the car. I need the girl alive.

10926
17:34:17,992 --> 17:34:19,607
What the hell did you do, Hattie?

10927
17:34:19,661 --> 17:34:21,117
A big brother lecture now, really? Huh?

10928
17:34:21,162 --> 17:34:23,278
I injected myself. I didn't have a choice.
He was gonna take it.

10929
17:34:36,010 --> 17:34:37,500
Program intercepting vector.

10930
17:35:02,787 --> 17:35:04,323
-You might wanna--
-Ah!

10931
17:36:01,179 --> 17:36:02,419
Might be time for some curls.

10932
17:36:04,474 --> 17:36:06,430
Let go!

10933
17:36:10,104 --> 17:36:11,389
Very good.

10934
17:36:14,651 --> 17:36:17,518
You wanna tell me just what in the
fresh turkey hell we're dealing with here?

10935
17:36:17,570 --> 17:36:18,980
Long story.

10936
17:36:19,030 --> 17:36:21,021
He's a ghost. Supposed to be dead.

10937
17:36:21,366 --> 17:36:23,573
Eight years ago,
I put a bullet through his brain.

10938
17:36:23,618 --> 17:36:26,405
Great, so we're being chased
by the Terminator.

10939
17:36:30,917 --> 17:36:31,952
I don't think he's gonna make it.

10940
17:36:32,001 --> 17:36:33,582
I don't think he can see
over the steering wheel.

10941
17:36:33,628 --> 17:36:35,459
Buckle up, fat boy,
I'm gonna save your life again.

10942
17:37:33,146 --> 17:37:34,386
You want a war, then?

10943
17:37:36,774 --> 17:37:37,809
Okay.

10944
17:37:51,914 --> 17:37:54,371
Okay, ride's over.
We gotta lose this car.

10945
17:38:02,008 --> 17:38:03,418
Update.

10946
17:38:03,468 --> 17:38:06,926
I've hacked the mainframe
of every news agency and outlet.

10947
17:38:06,971 --> 17:38:08,131
How many do we control?

10948
17:38:08,181 --> 17:38:10,388
Hundred and seventy-four broadcasts,
2,000 odd.

10949
17:38:10,433 --> 17:38:12,970
Double it.
I want 100% control of this story.

10950
17:38:13,019 --> 17:38:15,101
-Standard frame job.
-No, standard will not do.

10951
17:38:15,146 --> 17:38:16,682
I need something special for these guys.

10952
17:38:16,731 --> 17:38:18,471
So listen up. Narrative:

10953
17:38:18,524 --> 17:38:23,234
Hobbs, Shaw, big guy, little guy,
have been ID'd.

10954
17:38:23,279 --> 17:38:26,771
They've been blamed
for the recent attacks on the CIA.

10955
17:38:26,824 --> 17:38:29,736
They shared a prison cell
where they hatched a plan

10956
17:38:29,786 --> 17:38:32,368
to start their reign of terror.

10957
17:38:33,498 --> 17:38:34,783
Just got real.

10958
17:38:37,001 --> 17:38:39,913
-Who the hell are these guys?
-Eteon.

10959
17:38:39,962 --> 17:38:44,126
They're a secret tech cult, with
a mercenary army and plenty of dark money.

10960
17:38:44,884 --> 17:38:48,297
And delusions of saving the world
by augmenting the human race.

10961
17:38:48,346 --> 17:38:49,381
That's it.

10962
17:38:49,430 --> 17:38:51,261
Apparently they control the media as well.

10963
17:38:51,307 --> 17:38:53,298
Heard rumors about these people.

10964
17:38:53,851 --> 17:38:55,091
Everybody thinks they're a myth.

10965
17:38:56,062 --> 17:38:58,474
I've seen it firsthand
how real they are.

10966
17:38:58,523 --> 17:39:01,390
If you don't fit into their plans,
you've already dug your own grave.

10967
17:39:01,400 --> 17:39:03,231
All right, let's get to
the nearest lockdown facility--

10968
17:39:03,236 --> 17:39:04,817
Hey, no. You don't get it, do you?

10969
17:39:04,862 --> 17:39:08,730
Brixton's a tier-one assassin.
Best I've ever seen. I know him.

10970
17:39:08,783 --> 17:39:11,024
He ain't never gonna stop
until he gets that virus.

10971
17:39:11,077 --> 17:39:14,786
And besides, that's my sister.
Family business.

10972
17:39:14,831 --> 17:39:17,368
Is your name Shaw? No.
Then she's going nowhere with you.

10973
17:39:17,416 --> 17:39:19,828
When it comes to the fate of the world,
it becomes my business.

10974
17:39:19,877 --> 17:39:22,243
I don't care if she's your sister,
that woman ain't going anywhere--

10975
17:39:22,255 --> 17:39:23,415
-Where are you going?
-I'm going away.

10976
17:39:23,464 --> 17:39:26,251
I don't have time for your alpha male shit
right now. You're both idiots.

10977
17:39:26,300 --> 17:39:29,167
You clearly can't work together
and so you're absolutely useless to me.

10978
17:39:29,178 --> 17:39:32,261
So I'm gonna go find the man who can
help me get this thing out of my system.

10979
17:39:32,306 --> 17:39:33,921
-See ya.
-You mean this man?

10980
17:39:36,435 --> 17:39:37,800
I was tracking him before the attack.

10981
17:39:38,312 --> 17:39:40,394
He's hard to find,
but I think I got a hell of a lead.

10982
17:39:40,439 --> 17:39:41,645
Russian newspaper.

10983
17:39:41,691 --> 17:39:42,976
Not just any old paper.

10984
17:39:43,317 --> 17:39:45,649
There 's only one place
in London that sells that.

10985
17:40:01,169 --> 17:40:02,375
Call the director.

10986
17:40:07,884 --> 17:40:10,216
Well, well, Deckard Shaw.

10987
17:40:11,304 --> 17:40:12,794
How complicated for you.

10988
17:40:13,639 --> 17:40:14,674
Not really.

10989
17:40:15,099 --> 17:40:18,591
He's also working with DSS, Luke Hobbs.

10990
17:40:18,644 --> 17:40:21,260
Hobbs. We have a history.

10991
17:40:21,939 --> 17:40:23,099
They're formidable.

10992
17:40:23,482 --> 17:40:24,688
Small fry.

10993
17:40:24,734 --> 17:40:27,817
I'll eliminate the two of them.
Get the asset back ASAP.

10994
17:40:27,862 --> 17:40:29,398
You get the girl,

10995
17:40:29,447 --> 17:40:33,486
extract the virus
and reprogram it for phase one.

10996
17:40:33,534 --> 17:40:36,241
We use that weapon to eliminate the weak

10997
17:40:36,287 --> 17:40:38,369
and anyone who would get in our way.

10998
17:40:39,373 --> 17:40:41,364
We ’re building
the perfect system, Brixton.

10999
17:40:45,046 --> 17:40:46,331
Turn them.

11000
17:40:46,380 --> 17:40:47,495
"Turn 'em?"

11001
17:40:48,049 --> 17:40:49,209
Sorry, I don't follow.

11002
17:40:50,176 --> 17:40:53,668
I want them turned.
I want them working for the cause.

11003
17:40:53,721 --> 17:40:54,756
Understood?

11004
17:40:55,473 --> 17:40:56,633
They can't be turned.

11005
17:40:57,350 --> 17:40:59,090
What makes you so certain?

11006
17:40:59,560 --> 17:41:01,551
The last time we asked,
I got shot in the face.

11007
17:41:01,604 --> 17:41:04,061
That makes me very certain.

11008
17:41:04,106 --> 17:41:07,189
So, I suggest that
we take another approach.

11009
17:41:07,235 --> 17:41:09,521
-Which is why--
-I'm not asking, Brixton.

11010
17:41:09,570 --> 17:41:11,811
You show them the consequences of refusal.

11011
17:41:11,864 --> 17:41:15,027
Or perhaps I'll show them to you.

11012
17:41:15,076 --> 17:41:16,156
Is that a threat?

11013
17:41:16,786 --> 17:41:19,994
I'd remember who you're reliant on
for your survival.

11014
17:41:21,832 --> 17:41:23,163
All for the cause.

11015
17:41:28,130 --> 17:41:30,746
Look, honey, I have to talk to you about
something. It's very important right now.

11016
17:41:30,800 --> 17:41:33,291
Remember how we spoke about
what would happen if things went sideways?

11017
17:41:33,344 --> 17:41:36,882
We called it a "code red."
Well, it's happening.

11018
17:41:36,931 --> 17:41:38,296
Is there anything I can do?

11019
17:41:38,349 --> 17:41:40,806
You need to stay home.
You're gonna be safe there.

11020
17:41:40,851 --> 17:41:44,594
As a matter of fact, we've got the CIA
listening in on this call right now.

11021
17:41:45,064 --> 17:41:46,770
Watch this. Hi, Locke.

11022
17:41:46,816 --> 17:41:50,434
Everybody's safe, everybody's great.
I'm actually at our old diner here.

11023
17:41:50,486 --> 17:41:52,943
It's super weird being here
without you guys.

11024
17:41:54,782 --> 17:41:55,988
Think it's closed.

11025
17:41:57,326 --> 17:41:58,361
Thank you, brother.

11026
17:41:59,328 --> 17:42:02,070
Honey, I've already talked to Aunt Lisa.
She knows exactly what to do.

11027
17:42:02,123 --> 17:42:03,954
I’m gonna be home as soon as I can.

11028
17:42:04,750 --> 17:42:07,036
-Love you.
-I love you back.

11029
17:42:08,504 --> 17:42:09,539
Goodbye.

11030
17:42:11,549 --> 17:42:13,881
Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw.

11031
17:42:14,927 --> 17:42:16,918
While Hobbs is an agent in the American--

11032
17:42:17,346 --> 17:42:20,008
Tell us everything you know about this.

11033
17:42:20,683 --> 17:42:21,889
My God.

11034
17:42:23,060 --> 17:42:25,142
-When were you exposed?
-About 30 hours ago.

11035
17:42:25,187 --> 17:42:27,678
Then the capsules containing
the virus are still intact.

11036
17:42:27,732 --> 17:42:29,017
So we need to neutralize it.

11037
17:42:29,066 --> 17:42:30,101
No, it is not that easy.

11038
17:42:30,151 --> 17:42:34,144
It's not programmed to any DNA sequence.
It's fatal to everyone.

11039
17:42:34,196 --> 17:42:37,188
In 42 hours, the capsules will dissolve,
and she will be infected.

11040
17:42:37,241 --> 17:42:39,402
Then the virus will go airborne.

11041
17:42:39,452 --> 17:42:42,489
We are talking global contamination
within a week.

11042
17:42:42,538 --> 17:42:44,574
Why in the hell
would you create something like that?

11043
17:42:44,623 --> 17:42:46,864
-Because I thought I was one of them.
-Eteon.

11044
17:42:46,917 --> 17:42:49,829
They told me they wanted
to save the world through science.

11045
17:42:49,879 --> 17:42:51,335
I believed in their cause.

11046
17:42:51,380 --> 17:42:54,668
I developed the Snowflake
to be a carrier for vaccines,

11047
17:42:54,717 --> 17:42:56,332
a panacea for the whole world.

11048
17:42:56,385 --> 17:42:59,718
But they redeveloped it
into a programmable apocalypse.

11049
17:42:59,764 --> 17:43:04,474
To attack the weakest of us. Those not
worthy of Eteon's vision of the future.

11050
17:43:04,518 --> 17:43:06,383
For a scientist,
you seem incredibly stupid.

11051
17:43:06,437 --> 17:43:09,725
Well, I'm a two-times Nobel Prize winner,
but who's counting?

11052
17:43:09,774 --> 17:43:13,813
All right, you said the virus is
programmable. So... reprogram it.

11053
17:43:13,861 --> 17:43:15,852
I can't reprogram it in a host.

11054
17:43:15,905 --> 17:43:17,395
Just tell us how to
get this thing out from me.

11055
17:43:17,448 --> 17:43:19,109
Well, there are two options.

11056
17:43:19,617 --> 17:43:21,027
And the first is easy.

11057
17:43:21,077 --> 17:43:22,317
-Go.
-Finally.

11058
17:43:22,370 --> 17:43:23,906
-You kill her.
-Excuse me?

11059
17:43:23,954 --> 17:43:25,160
And burn the body, of course.

11060
17:43:25,206 --> 17:43:26,491
-Of course.
-Of course.

11061
17:43:26,540 --> 17:43:27,871
No, I mean really burn it.

11062
17:43:27,917 --> 17:43:29,077
-Really burn it.
-To ash.

11063
17:43:29,126 --> 17:43:31,117
-To ash?
-Beyond all recognition.

11064
17:43:31,170 --> 17:43:33,536
Let's assume that that's not an option,
shall we, genius?

11065
17:43:33,589 --> 17:43:35,250
Yeah, it doesn't work for us.
Option number two.

11066
17:43:35,299 --> 17:43:38,006
There is a machine that could
preserve her life and extract the virus.

11067
17:43:38,052 --> 17:43:39,542
That should've been option number one.

11068
17:43:39,595 --> 17:43:41,551
Because it's impossible to get to.

11069
17:43:41,597 --> 17:43:43,929
We'll decide what's impossible.
Where is it?

11070
17:43:46,602 --> 17:43:49,514
A secret dark-tech complex
fortiﬁed by an army

11071
17:43:49,563 --> 17:43:52,225
in the most godforsaken
part of the planet.

11072
17:43:52,274 --> 17:43:54,265
But if you go there,
all three of you will die.

11073
17:43:54,318 --> 17:43:57,481
So basically what you're saying is:
she dies no matter what.

11074
17:43:59,448 --> 17:44:01,655
Well, who needs a drink?

11075
17:44:02,701 --> 17:44:03,941
I know just the place.

11076
17:44:21,929 --> 17:44:23,510
Wow, look at all these.

11077
17:44:24,890 --> 17:44:26,175
Somebody's overcompensating.

11078
17:44:26,851 --> 17:44:28,933
If anything, I'm under-compensating.

11079
17:44:30,980 --> 17:44:33,642
And a teeny-tiny one. Just your size.

11080
17:44:35,651 --> 17:44:37,516
Used it for a job over in Italy.

11081
17:44:38,446 --> 17:44:40,858
Shame we didn't need
a weightlifting bus driver.

11082
17:44:41,449 --> 17:44:42,814
Would've given you a call.

11083
17:44:51,959 --> 17:44:52,994
Drink?

11084
17:44:53,836 --> 17:44:55,576
Yeah, I'll take a little one.

11085
17:45:12,062 --> 17:45:14,178
I'll write to someone in Moscow.
An old friend.

11086
17:45:14,231 --> 17:45:16,062
Yeah, we have a long history.

11087
17:45:16,108 --> 17:45:18,394
She and her crew are paying a visit
to some locals.

11088
17:45:18,444 --> 17:45:20,230
Particular Russian criminal element.

11089
17:45:20,279 --> 17:45:22,986
-They have things that we're gonna need.
-Considering your history with friends,

11090
17:45:23,032 --> 17:45:24,442
how many bullets you put
in this one's head?

11091
17:45:24,492 --> 17:45:26,983
They can set us up with gear,
and I don't hear any other ideas.

11092
17:45:27,036 --> 17:45:30,244
We know getting out of this country
is gonna be extremely difficult.

11093
17:45:30,289 --> 17:45:33,281
We have every major intelligence agency
already hunting us down.

11094
17:45:33,334 --> 17:45:36,792
And there's the fact that you disgraced
MI6 when you betrayed your team.

11095
17:45:43,594 --> 17:45:45,710
Don't believe everything they tell you.

11096
17:45:47,223 --> 17:45:48,338
Smile.

11097
17:45:53,562 --> 17:45:55,393
No, regular back channels
aren't gonna work this time.

11098
17:45:55,439 --> 17:45:56,975
We're gonna have to
do our best to blend in.

11099
17:45:57,024 --> 17:45:58,355
Hide in plain sight.

11100
17:45:58,400 --> 17:46:00,561
-That's why we'll be flying commercial.
-Commercial?

11101
17:46:00,611 --> 17:46:02,647
We're gonna get spotted too easy at--

11102
17:46:03,739 --> 17:46:05,946
Don't worry that pea-sized brain.
I handled it.

11103
17:46:05,991 --> 17:46:07,982
Cloned our cell phone signals
around the world.

11104
17:46:08,035 --> 17:46:10,026
Should buy us at least 48 hours.

11105
17:46:10,079 --> 17:46:11,694
We'll pick up new gear
when we get to Moscow.

11106
17:46:11,747 --> 17:46:13,612
Should get us past the wandering eyes
at the airport.

11107
17:46:14,416 --> 17:46:16,907
This is probably the only thing
that's gonna fit.

11108
17:46:18,295 --> 17:46:19,535
Fit what, a Smurf?

11109
17:46:19,964 --> 17:46:21,500
I think that's one of my old ones.

11110
17:46:21,549 --> 17:46:24,291
I apologize in advance
if it's a little loose around the balls.

11111
17:46:25,636 --> 17:46:28,048
Okay. What do we got, tough guy? Come on.

11112
17:46:28,097 --> 17:46:31,385
I've created new identities
and altered your biometric profiles

11113
17:46:31,433 --> 17:46:34,345
so the airport scanners don't recognize
your faces or your ﬁngerprints.

11114
17:46:34,395 --> 17:46:36,932
You're Sarah Atkins.
You work in insurance.

11115
17:46:36,981 --> 17:46:38,061
Hello.

11116
17:46:41,026 --> 17:46:43,142
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

11117
17:46:43,195 --> 17:46:44,776
I'm Franz Gruber.

11118
17:46:44,822 --> 17:46:48,656
I'm a freelance architect,
avid mountain climber,

11119
17:46:48,701 --> 17:46:50,566
and a part-time ski instructor.

11120
17:46:53,330 --> 17:46:57,243
-Thank you.
-And you, you're Michael Oxmaul.

11121
17:46:59,587 --> 17:47:00,952
"Mike Oxmaul."

11122
17:47:05,926 --> 17:47:06,961
I go by Michael.

11123
17:47:08,887 --> 17:47:11,424
-Freeze! Stop, sir! Stop there!
-Stay right where you are!

11124
17:47:11,473 --> 17:47:13,464
-Stay there!
-It's Mike. It's Mike Oxmaul.

11125
17:47:13,517 --> 17:47:16,179
It's not small. And my name's Michael.

11126
17:47:16,228 --> 17:47:18,469
They've stopped him for what, exactly?

11127
17:47:18,522 --> 17:47:22,356
Whatever it is, it's gonna involve
rubber gloves and a body cavity search.

11128
17:47:22,401 --> 17:47:23,436
Let's go.

11129
17:47:26,780 --> 17:47:28,736
Hands on your head, Oxmaul.

11130
17:47:36,165 --> 17:47:37,530
Can't believe you did that.

11131
17:47:37,583 --> 17:47:39,289
He was gonna slow us down.

11132
17:47:42,087 --> 17:47:44,453
We can't pull this off. We both know it.

11133
17:47:45,299 --> 17:47:46,789
It's bad enough
I got this thing in my blood

11134
17:47:46,842 --> 17:47:48,252
that's gonna kill me and everyone else,

11135
17:47:48,302 --> 17:47:50,463
but were you seriously gonna break
this mysterious machine

11136
17:47:50,512 --> 17:47:53,128
out of some
high-security death virus complex

11137
17:47:53,182 --> 17:47:54,843
and magically get it to work?

11138
17:47:54,892 --> 17:47:57,224
-Frankly, that sounds completely--
-You still wear that silly thing?

11139
17:47:59,438 --> 17:48:00,848
Didn't know you still had that.

11140
17:48:01,982 --> 17:48:03,222
Put the pin back in.

11141
17:48:04,693 --> 17:48:05,808
You haven't changed.

11142
17:48:09,490 --> 17:48:11,526
Wish I could say the same about you.

11143
17:48:11,575 --> 17:48:13,566
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

11144
17:48:14,578 --> 17:48:17,240
We're gonna make this work.
It's what we do.

11145
17:48:18,457 --> 17:48:19,663
And what if we don't?

11146
17:48:22,169 --> 17:48:24,501
-What if the only option is for you to--
-It's not happening.

11147
17:48:26,090 --> 17:48:28,752
Hi, I'm here. I'm Michael.

11148
17:48:33,013 --> 17:48:34,219
Hi, yeah.

11149
17:48:34,848 --> 17:48:36,713
Hello. All right.

11150
17:48:38,268 --> 17:48:42,511
Oh, yeah, let's see. Where's my seat?

11151
17:48:42,564 --> 17:48:44,976
F-one, F-two...

11152
17:48:46,235 --> 17:48:47,270
F you.

11153
17:48:50,030 --> 17:48:51,110
Hey.

11154
17:48:54,952 --> 17:48:56,943
You are an asshole.

11155
17:48:57,454 --> 17:48:58,694
You were quicker than I thought.

11156
17:48:58,747 --> 17:49:00,578
Yup. Because I have
a secret weapon.

11157
17:49:00,624 --> 17:49:02,239
People actually like me.

11158
17:49:02,918 --> 17:49:05,159
You wouldn't understand that
because you don't have any friends.

11159
17:49:10,592 --> 17:49:11,877
I love your babushka.

11160
17:49:48,172 --> 17:49:50,709
Couldn't have booked an emergency row
for a little bit more legroom?

11161
17:49:50,758 --> 17:49:53,591
Not everybody has hobbit legs like you.

11162
17:49:53,635 --> 17:49:58,379
Hey, look, in case you didn't realize,
I couldn't give a damn about your comfort.

11163
17:49:58,432 --> 17:50:00,388
So why don't you be a good elephant,

11164
17:50:00,434 --> 17:50:04,268
suck up another kilo of peanuts,
put your chair back and relax?

11165
17:50:04,688 --> 17:50:07,270
Listen, don't ever tell me to relax.
Don't tell me to do anything.

11166
17:50:07,316 --> 17:50:08,772
Any time you ever say anything,

11167
17:50:08,817 --> 17:50:11,354
it makes me want to take my boot
and shove it so far up your ass,

11168
17:50:11,403 --> 17:50:13,143
you're gonna be
spitting out Shoelaces all week.

11169
17:50:13,197 --> 17:50:15,233
Hey, you know what the problem is?

11170
17:50:15,908 --> 17:50:18,240
I'll tell you the problem. This job.

11171
17:50:18,285 --> 17:50:20,071
This job requires stealth.

11172
17:50:20,871 --> 17:50:23,613
And you... look at you.

11173
17:50:23,665 --> 17:50:28,125
I mean, granted, it's not your fault.
But you're too obvious.

11174
17:50:28,170 --> 17:50:32,413
You stick out. Like balls on a bulldog.

11175
17:50:32,466 --> 17:50:35,173
Dangling down in all the wrong places.

11176
17:50:35,219 --> 17:50:36,834
Seemingly harmless.

11177
17:50:39,181 --> 17:50:42,014
And the next thing you know,
they're trying to impregnate your sister.

11178
17:50:42,059 --> 17:50:43,674
What?

11179
17:50:44,895 --> 17:50:46,977
-Impregnate your sister?
-You heard.

11180
17:50:48,148 --> 17:50:49,513
Oh...

11181
17:50:51,151 --> 17:50:52,186
Now I get it.

11182
17:50:52,236 --> 17:50:56,195
You do? Good. I'm glad. Yeah, I'm glad.

11183
17:50:56,240 --> 17:50:57,855
-I'm very glad.
-You actually think that

11184
17:50:57,908 --> 17:51:00,399
I'm going through all this effort,
on this mission,

11185
17:51:00,452 --> 17:51:03,615
trying to save the world,
by the way, for a fourth time,

11186
17:51:03,664 --> 17:51:05,245
because I'm really good at it.

11187
17:51:05,290 --> 17:51:08,578
You think I'm going through all of this
just so I can do the horizontal-hula,

11188
17:51:08,627 --> 17:51:10,663
sexy, sexy time with your sister?

11189
17:51:10,712 --> 17:51:13,044
Not all. Most.

11190
17:51:13,090 --> 17:51:16,958
Let me break it down for you, Frodo.
This ain't 1955 anymore, all right?

11191
17:51:17,010 --> 17:51:20,173
Despite the fact that that girl sleeping
right there is related to you,

11192
17:51:20,222 --> 17:51:23,214
she's still one of the toughest,
baddest, most capable women

11193
17:51:23,267 --> 17:51:25,383
I've ever encountered in my entire life.

11194
17:51:25,435 --> 17:51:28,768
And if she chooses to look the way

11195
17:51:28,814 --> 17:51:31,647
of this big, brown,

11196
17:51:31,692 --> 17:51:37,688
well-endowed, tattooed
mountain of a man, then guess what.

11197
17:51:38,282 --> 17:51:40,489
I'm gonna let her climb this mountain

11198
17:51:40,534 --> 17:51:45,278
over and over and over again.

11199
17:51:45,330 --> 17:51:46,945
You stay away from her.

11200
17:51:47,499 --> 17:51:50,616
I see what you're doing.
You think I'm stupid?

11201
17:51:50,669 --> 17:51:53,081
Of course I think you're stupid.
But you know what? I'll do you a favor.

11202
17:51:53,130 --> 17:51:55,746
I'll knock that dumb right out of
your skull. You just say the word, jack.

11203
17:51:55,799 --> 17:51:56,834
You know what I wanna do?

11204
17:51:56,884 --> 17:52:01,503
I wanna do an Irish jig
on your arse-ugly face at 30,000 feet.

11205
17:52:01,555 --> 17:52:02,965
-Oh, 30,000 feet.
-Yeah.

11206
17:52:03,015 --> 17:52:04,471
-So you wanna dance right now?
-Yeah.

11207
17:52:04,516 --> 17:52:06,848
The only thing holding you back
is air and opportunity.

11208
17:52:06,894 --> 17:52:09,101
And there goes the air.

11209
17:52:09,146 --> 17:52:10,727
-Bring it on, Don Ho.
-"Don Ho?"

11210
17:52:10,772 --> 17:52:13,013
That's enough! Hey, cut it out.

11211
17:52:13,066 --> 17:52:14,272
Both of y'all, cut it out.

11212
17:52:14,318 --> 17:52:16,479
Oh, see? You woke up the air marshal.

11213
17:52:16,528 --> 17:52:17,859
You woke the air marshal.

11214
17:52:17,905 --> 17:52:19,896
-How'd you know I was the air marshal?
-Unaccompanied.

11215
17:52:19,948 --> 17:52:21,859
-Late boarding the plane.
-Aisle seat.

11216
17:52:21,909 --> 17:52:23,365
-Golf shirt.
-Golf shirt.

11217
17:52:25,370 --> 17:52:27,531
Let's just call that an educated guess.

11218
17:52:28,165 --> 17:52:30,121
Air Marshal Dinkley, at your service.

11219
17:52:30,167 --> 17:52:32,283
I'm sorry, did you just say "Dinkley?"

11220
17:52:32,336 --> 17:52:34,622
What's the problem? Dinkley.

11221
17:52:35,213 --> 17:52:38,250
I understand this big fella,
because it's my job to observe.

11222
17:52:38,300 --> 17:52:41,667
Thick neck, your head's been on a swivel
since you've been on this damn plane.

11223
17:52:41,720 --> 17:52:44,462
Every passenger that's got on here
you been checking out.

11224
17:52:44,514 --> 17:52:45,674
You're a lawman.

11225
17:52:45,724 --> 17:52:48,386
And you, Mr. Armani pants, you're a spy.

11226
17:52:49,561 --> 17:52:51,097
-He's pretty good.
-Not bad.

11227
17:52:51,146 --> 17:52:52,807
I get it. We're all big guys.

11228
17:52:52,856 --> 17:52:54,596
The three of us. Alphas.

11229
17:52:55,025 --> 17:52:57,437
Three apex predators cooped up in the sky.

11230
17:52:57,486 --> 17:52:58,851
Tensions get high.

11231
17:52:58,904 --> 17:53:01,020
What you throwing up on the bench?
Three, four hundred pounds?

11232
17:53:02,157 --> 17:53:04,443
-Little less.
-Yeah, light work.

11233
17:53:04,493 --> 17:53:07,280
I'm doing the same thing. Slagging weight.

11234
17:53:07,329 --> 17:53:08,739
Clanging and banging.

11235
17:53:08,789 --> 17:53:10,074
What you into?

11236
17:53:10,123 --> 17:53:12,079
Hot yoga? Pilates?

11237
17:53:12,125 --> 17:53:14,036
Probably mess around in the Octagon.

11238
17:53:14,086 --> 17:53:18,125
Yeah, you wanna know what I do?
I sit in a can of farts all day long.

11239
17:53:18,548 --> 17:53:20,004
That's what I'm dealing with.

11240
17:53:20,050 --> 17:53:22,962
It's an occasional terrorist
and a lot of recycled ass.

11241
17:53:23,011 --> 17:53:24,842
I would give anything
to be on the front line again

11242
17:53:25,681 --> 17:53:26,716
"Again?"

11243
17:53:27,683 --> 17:53:29,844
-What?
-I was a compartmented element for JSOC.

11244
17:53:29,893 --> 17:53:30,928
You were in Delta?

11245
17:53:30,978 --> 17:53:33,139
Sabre Squad Echo, 24/7, baby.

11246
17:53:33,188 --> 17:53:36,271
"Echo?" Those guys were the warlocks
because of the magic they could do.

11247
17:53:36,316 --> 17:53:37,681
-That's right.
-If that's the case,

11248
17:53:37,734 --> 17:53:39,520
then I'ma say "abracadabra," bitches.

11249
17:53:39,569 --> 17:53:41,309
You're looking at the magic.

11250
17:53:41,363 --> 17:53:44,730
You know what your problem is?
Your balance is off.

11251
17:53:44,783 --> 17:53:46,193
You need a third squaddie.

11252
17:53:46,243 --> 17:53:47,403
-No, no, we're good.
-No.

11253
17:53:47,452 --> 17:53:48,737
I know the game.

11254
17:53:48,787 --> 17:53:51,779
You hear me? I know the game.

11255
17:53:51,832 --> 17:53:54,039
-What are you doing?
-What do you mean, "What am I doing?"

11256
17:53:54,084 --> 17:53:56,575
-Don't talk like that.
-You sound different.

11257
17:53:56,628 --> 17:53:58,334
-Do I?
-That's not your voice.

11258
17:53:58,380 --> 17:53:59,745
Use your regular voice.

11259
17:53:59,798 --> 17:54:04,337
This is my regular voice.
I'm talking like the warlocks talk, baby.

11260
17:54:04,386 --> 17:54:05,922
They don't talk like that.

11261
17:54:05,971 --> 17:54:08,007
I'm just showing you.
That's all, guys. Look...

11262
17:54:08,056 --> 17:54:11,548
all I'm saying is I could complete
this holy trinity that you guys have.

11263
17:54:11,601 --> 17:54:12,886
Three would be too much.

11264
17:54:13,520 --> 17:54:15,135
Here's my résumé. This is my card.

11265
17:54:15,188 --> 17:54:18,430
'Cause if you need stuff, I'm the guy
that you call to get what you need.

11266
17:54:18,483 --> 17:54:21,316
You want a Citation X? You want a GV?
You want a Boeing 747?

11267
17:54:21,361 --> 17:54:24,148
You want a helicopter?
You want something stealth?

11268
17:54:24,614 --> 17:54:26,980
I'm an air marshal. I'm your guy.

11269
17:54:33,540 --> 17:54:35,952
Please. Please let me go.

11270
17:54:40,964 --> 17:54:43,455
What do you want?

11271
17:54:43,508 --> 17:54:45,624
I want our property
out of that girl's blood.

11272
17:54:45,677 --> 17:54:48,339
No, the virus is too dangerous. I can't!

11273
17:54:58,482 --> 17:55:00,723
Humans must evolve, Professor.

11274
17:55:00,776 --> 17:55:02,607
Without Eteon's upgrades,

11275
17:55:02,652 --> 17:55:05,815
the human body's
really not worth that much.

11276
17:55:05,906 --> 17:55:10,525
Maybe 11 pence worth of magnesium,
couple of pence worth of calcium,

11277
17:55:10,577 --> 17:55:11,908
little bit of iron.

11278
17:55:13,080 --> 17:55:14,490
Not worth much.

11279
17:55:14,539 --> 17:55:18,452
I'd say, all in all,
probably about three pound.

11280
17:55:19,086 --> 17:55:21,418
Three pound fifty, max.

11281
17:55:22,047 --> 17:55:25,710
The entirety of a man's worth,
small change.

11282
17:55:27,385 --> 17:55:30,377
You're gonna reprogram that virus for me.

11283
17:55:30,430 --> 17:55:31,465
I won't.

11284
17:55:56,873 --> 17:55:59,865
Ah, your friend's a Russian mobster.

11285
17:55:59,918 --> 17:56:01,954
This girl steals from Russian mobsters.

11286
17:56:02,379 --> 17:56:04,586
Actually, she steals from everyone.

11287
17:56:04,631 --> 17:56:06,212
It's kind of her thing.

11288
17:56:16,101 --> 17:56:17,261
Deckard Shaw.

11289
17:56:18,687 --> 17:56:19,802
Margarita.

11290
17:56:38,623 --> 17:56:40,488
Oh, I did not see that coming.

11291
17:56:41,001 --> 17:56:42,707
I wish I didn't see that at all.

11292
17:56:43,837 --> 17:56:44,872
Me too.

11293
17:56:45,797 --> 17:56:46,912
I got your list.

11294
17:56:47,799 --> 17:56:49,960
It's long.

11295
17:56:50,010 --> 17:56:51,921
I asked for a house on a runway.

11296
17:56:51,970 --> 17:56:54,962
Not sure a dozen Russians in duct tape
were on the list.

11297
17:56:55,015 --> 17:56:56,926
Well, give me more
than three-hour notice,

11298
17:56:56,975 --> 17:56:59,512
and I wouldn't have to
resort to such extremes.

11299
17:56:59,561 --> 17:57:03,304
Not sure three hours has anything to do
with your extremes, Margarita.

11300
17:57:03,773 --> 17:57:06,264
Qué mierda, Deckard.

11301
17:57:06,902 --> 17:57:10,269
Eteon. Could you pick
a harder place to break into?

11302
17:57:10,322 --> 17:57:14,031
We need to find the C-17 viral
extraction machine. Could be anywhere.

11303
17:57:14,075 --> 17:57:16,566
That facility is
three square miles of research labs.

11304
17:57:16,620 --> 17:57:19,953
Yeah. And it's a powder keg
packed with munitions.

11305
17:57:19,998 --> 17:57:21,534
We've gotta pull a Mick Jagger.

11306
17:57:22,626 --> 17:57:23,786
This sounds like a fun game.

11307
17:57:23,835 --> 17:57:25,826
We're not getting you on the inside. No.

11308
17:57:25,879 --> 17:57:28,962
When Deck and I were kids,
we'd spend our time coming up with grifts.

11309
17:57:29,007 --> 17:57:32,124
A "Mick Jagger" was a job
that required one person to showboat

11310
17:57:32,177 --> 17:57:35,761
to draw all the eyes
while the others made the music.

11311
17:57:36,223 --> 17:57:37,963
A typical inside job.

11312
17:57:40,977 --> 17:57:44,140
Guys, you heard Andreiko.
They have to use the extraction machine.

11313
17:57:44,189 --> 17:57:45,554
So they'll take me right to it.

11314
17:57:46,483 --> 17:57:47,723
No, I can do it.

11315
17:57:49,027 --> 17:57:50,187
We can do it.

11316
17:57:51,112 --> 17:57:54,229
So now the only question is
how to ring Eteon's dinner bell.

11317
17:57:54,282 --> 17:57:56,238
Oh, I can handle that part.

11318
17:57:56,284 --> 17:57:58,445
But ﬁrst, let's get you geared up.

11319
17:58:00,664 --> 17:58:02,325
These are your HALO parachutes.

11320
17:58:05,001 --> 17:58:07,367
Earbuds for encrypted communication.

11321
17:58:07,921 --> 17:58:10,412
Scorpion EVO 3 with optical sights.

11322
17:58:11,591 --> 17:58:13,957
Ultra-thin bullet-resisting Kevlar.

11323
17:58:14,970 --> 17:58:17,177
Infrared cameras for seeing through walls.

11324
17:58:17,889 --> 17:58:19,220
And last but not least,

11325
17:58:19,641 --> 17:58:21,302
compact hydrogen detonator.

11326
17:58:22,018 --> 17:58:25,351
Put it in the right spot,
it'll blow the place sky-high.

11327
17:58:26,606 --> 17:58:27,641
How do I look?

11328
17:58:28,817 --> 17:58:29,932
Looks a little tight.

11329
17:58:37,409 --> 17:58:38,524
How you holding up?

11330
17:58:39,911 --> 17:58:42,869
You know, if things go south in there,
you can't leave me alive.

11331
17:58:45,083 --> 17:58:46,573
We're gonna get you out of there.

11332
17:58:47,377 --> 17:58:48,787
Let me tell you something else.

11333
17:58:49,296 --> 17:58:53,164
"The key to immortality
is first living a life worth remembering."

11334
17:58:54,801 --> 17:58:57,213
-Is that more Nietzsche?
-Nah.

11335
17:58:57,262 --> 17:58:58,468
That's Bruce Lee.

11336
17:59:00,849 --> 17:59:02,214
Come on.

11337
17:59:10,567 --> 17:59:11,647
How'd you ﬁnd her?

11338
17:59:12,319 --> 17:59:14,401
You've heard about me. I'm good at my job.

11339
17:59:15,030 --> 17:59:16,145
Was she alone?

11340
17:59:17,365 --> 17:59:18,400
Yeah.

11341
17:59:19,951 --> 17:59:22,442
If you're lying to me,
I will cut your heart out.

11342
17:59:22,495 --> 17:59:23,655
Do you understand?

11343
17:59:25,582 --> 17:59:27,413
I'd be afraid if I had one.

11344
17:59:58,907 --> 18:00:00,067
Now that's a ride.

11345
18:00:00,116 --> 18:00:01,447
What a ride.

11346
18:00:01,493 --> 18:00:02,778
I got shotgun.

11347
18:00:03,244 --> 18:00:07,237
-I got shotgun.
-No, no, no. Don't start. I got shotgun.

11348
18:00:12,379 --> 18:00:13,789
We're entering the drop zone!

11349
18:00:13,838 --> 18:00:15,999
-Are you ready?
-Yeah, I'm ready.

11350
18:00:16,049 --> 18:00:17,255
-On my three!
-Okay.

11351
18:00:17,300 --> 18:00:18,710
-One!
-Uh-huh.

11352
18:00:19,969 --> 18:00:21,584
Ah! You asshole!

11353
18:00:21,638 --> 18:00:22,969
Whoo!

11354
18:00:30,647 --> 18:00:32,512
Nobody tells me what to do.

11355
18:00:49,416 --> 18:00:51,748
So, I'm intrigued,
do you wash the blood off your hands

11356
18:00:51,793 --> 18:00:54,626
before you count your money
or is it afterwards?

11357
18:01:04,139 --> 18:01:05,254
Dismissed.

11358
18:01:06,766 --> 18:01:10,224
You don't get it, do you?
You know, the weak deal with money.

11359
18:01:10,270 --> 18:01:12,761
We deal with evolutionary change.

11360
18:01:12,814 --> 18:01:15,396
Change that sometimes require
acts of violence.

11361
18:01:15,442 --> 18:01:17,307
Like killing innocent people with viruses?

11362
18:01:17,360 --> 18:01:18,475
Only the weak ones.

11363
18:01:18,528 --> 18:01:21,565
We're dealing with the future of
the planet. Things that money cannot buy.

11364
18:01:21,614 --> 18:01:24,071
Oh, like your soul back?

11365
18:01:24,451 --> 18:01:25,657
My soul?

11366
18:01:26,286 --> 18:01:27,651
Your brother took my soul.

11367
18:01:28,705 --> 18:01:30,536
The boys in the lab made me a new one.

11368
18:01:31,082 --> 18:01:32,322
Now, that's progress.

11369
18:01:49,851 --> 18:01:52,558
Welcome to the extraction room, Miss Shaw.

11370
18:01:54,898 --> 18:01:56,308
Get her ready.

11371
18:01:58,651 --> 18:01:59,857
It won't be long.

11372
18:02:06,367 --> 18:02:09,325
I tell you, we ain't gonna want
to be here when this thing goes off.

11373
18:02:10,997 --> 18:02:13,534
Looks like she's 400 yards through there.

11374
18:02:13,583 --> 18:02:15,539
Looks like they're holding her
in some sort of medical pod.

11375
18:02:15,585 --> 18:02:18,292
Timer's set for 45 minutes.
We get in and get out.

11376
18:02:18,338 --> 18:02:21,296
Blow this death factory to pieces.
Remember the hallway.

11377
18:02:21,341 --> 18:02:24,128
-No guns.
-Right. Those guys have to be alive.

11378
18:02:24,177 --> 18:02:25,292
Because at the end of the hallway,

11379
18:02:25,345 --> 18:02:27,336
the retinal scanner needs a match
to open the door.

11380
18:02:27,805 --> 18:02:29,511
-Pick a door.
-I'm right there.

11381
18:02:29,557 --> 18:02:30,763
Nope, that's my door.

11382
18:02:30,808 --> 18:02:31,968
What's the matter with you?

11383
18:02:37,524 --> 18:02:39,856
I made a mistake. This is your door.

11384
18:02:39,901 --> 18:02:42,392
Oh, no. No backsies. What's the matter?

11385
18:02:42,445 --> 18:02:44,060
You got a lot of bad guys
behind that door?

11386
18:02:44,113 --> 18:02:46,274
Watch this. You might learn something.

11387
18:03:21,609 --> 18:03:23,440
Watch this.

11388
18:03:48,177 --> 18:03:49,257
Eh.

11389
18:04:21,252 --> 18:04:22,788
Enter corresponding match.

11390
18:04:22,837 --> 18:04:24,668

11391
18:04:25,465 --> 18:04:27,001

You come and do it!

11400
18:04:59,457 --> 18:05:01,288
Access granted.

11401
18:05:03,544 --> 18:05:04,750
Doors opening.

11402
18:05:12,887 --> 18:05:15,219
Very good. Well done, boys.

11403
18:05:16,307 --> 18:05:18,138
I'm impressed that you even got in here.

11404
18:06:01,561 --> 18:06:05,679
That-- That's... That's not possible.

11405
18:06:10,069 --> 18:06:13,106
-No. What are you doing?
-Having to extract it myself.

11406
18:06:16,576 --> 18:06:17,611
Wait!

11407
18:06:41,184 --> 18:06:44,176
There he is. Nice and rested?

11408
18:06:44,896 --> 18:06:48,013
Get your full eight hours?
I was gonna order some room service.

11409
18:06:48,941 --> 18:06:51,728
What do you fancy?
French toast? I'll get the order in.

11410
18:06:51,778 --> 18:06:53,939
I just dreamt they killed you
before I woke up.

11411
18:06:54,947 --> 18:06:56,437
Pretty disappointed right now.

11412
18:06:56,491 --> 18:06:59,449
It's a little elaborate, I must admit.

11413
18:06:59,494 --> 18:07:02,907
Old-school interrogation technique
we picked up in black ops.

11414
18:07:02,955 --> 18:07:05,617
Shock will kill a man in three.
Do you remember that, Deck?

11415
18:07:06,209 --> 18:07:08,370
Yeah, I remember
a lot of things from back then.

11416
18:07:08,795 --> 18:07:11,002
I reckon you've only got
four shocks in you, boys.

11417
18:07:11,088 --> 18:07:12,794
Yeah? I think we could take ﬁve.

11418
18:07:12,840 --> 18:07:15,206
"Five?" Well, all right.

11419
18:07:26,604 --> 18:07:28,720
You had to open your big mouth, didn't ya?

11420
18:07:29,440 --> 18:07:31,522
I thought it was a cool thing
to say in the moment.

11421
18:07:49,460 --> 18:07:51,371
Do you remember
when we were real brothers?

11422
18:07:51,420 --> 18:07:54,082
Task Force Black.
Do you remember that, Deck?

11423
18:07:54,090 --> 18:07:56,456
Man, we ended up
seeing the worst in people.

11424
18:07:56,509 --> 18:08:01,219
Worst in our countries, our leaders,
our enemies, our friends.

11425
18:08:01,264 --> 18:08:03,050
You don't know
the meaning of that word anymore.

11426
18:08:03,099 --> 18:08:05,090
But don't worry about it, neither does he.

11427
18:08:05,142 --> 18:08:06,257
He shoots them right in the head,

11428
18:08:06,310 --> 18:08:08,050
but in your case,
I thought it was a hell of a good idea.

11429
18:08:08,104 --> 18:08:09,685
Big man, you still talking?

11430
18:08:09,730 --> 18:08:11,561
I said I thought it was a hell of a good--

11431
18:08:20,074 --> 18:08:21,234
Shit.

11432
18:08:21,284 --> 18:08:24,947
You know, it's funny
how humanity's hate for each other

11433
18:08:24,954 --> 18:08:26,990
is stronger
than its own self-preservation,

11434
18:08:26,998 --> 18:08:28,363
which is why we're here.

11435
18:08:28,457 --> 18:08:31,995
Remember eight years ago, Deck,
when Eteon asked us to join their mission?

11436
18:08:32,044 --> 18:08:33,909
Oh, you mean their death cult.

11437
18:08:34,463 --> 18:08:36,624
-They're lunatics.
-Visionaries.

11438
18:08:36,674 --> 18:08:40,383
Visionaries of a future.
A bigger future. A brighter future.

11439
18:08:40,428 --> 18:08:42,419
You remember the data they gave us, man.

11440
18:08:42,471 --> 18:08:46,760
What with environmental damage,
capitalism, terrorism,

11441
18:08:46,767 --> 18:08:49,554
humanity wipes itself out by 2096.

11442
18:08:49,604 --> 18:08:51,140
Now, that is scary to me.

11443
18:08:51,188 --> 18:08:53,679
But if we fulﬁll Eteon's vision,

11444
18:08:53,733 --> 18:08:56,475
-you save their world.
-You don't save the world with genocide.

11445
18:08:56,527 --> 18:08:58,358
Genocide, schmenocide.

11446
18:08:58,946 --> 18:09:00,482
You know what this virus is?

11447
18:09:01,157 --> 18:09:03,773
This virus is a necessary
shock to the system.

11448
18:09:17,757 --> 18:09:19,588
Whoo! That's three.

11449
18:09:20,176 --> 18:09:22,258
I love this thing.

11450
18:09:22,303 --> 18:09:26,967
Told you then, I'm telling you now,
your metrics are off.

11451
18:09:27,433 --> 18:09:30,596
One good reason:
You assume the worst in people.

11452
18:09:30,645 --> 18:09:34,058
People cannot be trusted to do
the right thing. Look at the two of you.

11453
18:09:34,148 --> 18:09:36,764
The fate of the world is in your hands,
and you can't even get along.

11454
18:09:37,485 --> 18:09:40,192
But you know all about doing
the right thing, don't you, Shaw?

11455
18:09:44,951 --> 18:09:46,612
Little souvenir, huh, bro?

11456
18:09:48,788 --> 18:09:52,076
You come to kill me,
I'll do the same every time.

11457
18:09:53,125 --> 18:09:54,410
What'd you expect? A shiatsu?

11458
18:09:57,755 --> 18:09:58,790
Anyone talking to you?

11459
18:09:59,924 --> 18:10:00,959
Your mama.

11460
18:10:06,555 --> 18:10:08,637
Yeah!

11461
18:10:09,225 --> 18:10:12,638
I get it. You're still mad.

11462
18:10:12,687 --> 18:10:16,555
You're upset because,
hey, when you wouldn't turn,

11463
18:10:16,565 --> 18:10:18,806
they asked me to come and kill you,
and, of course, I had to

11464
18:10:18,818 --> 18:10:20,354
because you knew too much.

11465
18:10:21,278 --> 18:10:24,361
But I think about that night a lot.
I think about it.

11466
18:10:24,407 --> 18:10:27,399
Because what I realize now
that I did not realize then

11467
18:10:27,451 --> 18:10:30,363
is that when you shot me,
you gave me a gift.

11468
18:10:30,454 --> 18:10:33,412
Look at me. I'm black Superman.

11469
18:10:34,083 --> 18:10:36,199
Bulletproof, new spine,

11470
18:10:36,252 --> 18:10:40,040
and the more machine I become,
the more humane I am.

11471
18:10:40,047 --> 18:10:42,083
This is what you wanna fight for.

11472
18:10:42,633 --> 18:10:45,545
I'm giving you another
chance to join us, Deckard.

11473
18:10:45,594 --> 18:10:47,835
And the boss wants big mouth as well.

11474
18:10:47,888 --> 18:10:49,253
If not, I kill you both.

11475
18:10:49,807 --> 18:10:52,219
Which, honestly, I'd love to do.

11476
18:10:53,936 --> 18:10:56,769
You know Eteon.
You know what they're capable of.

11477
18:10:56,814 --> 18:10:59,897
They rebuilt me. Dismantled him.

11478
18:10:59,942 --> 18:11:05,062
Made it look he killed his own team.
Even your own sister... disowned you.

11479
18:11:08,576 --> 18:11:12,114
Just say the word, bro.
Say the word and all of this goes away.

11480
18:11:12,580 --> 18:11:14,992
Your sister lives. His daughter lives.

11481
18:11:15,041 --> 18:11:18,750
We get you some upgrades,
and we go on to saving the world.

11482
18:11:20,629 --> 18:11:21,835
What's it to be?

11483
18:11:21,881 --> 18:11:24,873
Join the evolution of man,
or die with the weak?

11484
18:11:27,094 --> 18:11:28,425
Just get it done.

11485
18:11:29,597 --> 18:11:33,010
I told the boss you wouldn't
change your mind.

11486
18:11:33,059 --> 18:11:34,549
See you later.

11487
18:11:34,602 --> 18:11:36,467
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait!

11488
18:11:38,773 --> 18:11:40,354
I think we should join.

11489
18:11:40,399 --> 18:11:41,605
Join?

11490
18:11:44,070 --> 18:11:46,186
You said some really compelling things.

11491
18:11:46,238 --> 18:11:49,230
I mean, that black Superman thing,
that really got me. I love that.

11492
18:11:49,283 --> 18:11:51,740
What are you, deaf, stupid, or both?
We ain't joining.

11493
18:11:51,786 --> 18:11:54,619
There you go again, you're just thinking
about yourself. You're such a diva.

11494
18:11:54,663 --> 18:11:56,278
What about my feelings, for once?

11495
18:11:56,332 --> 18:11:59,665
Let me tell you something,
if we were a band, you know who you'd be?

11496
18:11:59,710 --> 18:12:00,950
You'd be Mick Jagger.

11497
18:12:01,003 --> 18:12:02,243
"Mick Jagger?"

11498
18:12:03,714 --> 18:12:04,749
Mick Jagger.

11499
18:12:05,549 --> 18:12:07,414
Oi, what's it to be?

11500
18:12:07,802 --> 18:12:09,167
In or out?

11501
18:12:14,308 --> 18:12:15,844
-We're not gonna join.
-We're not gonna join.

11502
18:12:15,893 --> 18:12:18,475
But since you're standing there,
here's what I'm gonna do.

11503
18:12:18,521 --> 18:12:22,105
I'm gonna rip the arm off this chair.
I'm gonna smash him right in the face.

11504
18:12:22,149 --> 18:12:24,105
Stab him right in the neck
for looking that way.

11505
18:12:24,151 --> 18:12:26,312
Kill all 13 guys in seven seconds.

11506
18:12:26,362 --> 18:12:27,772
And here's what I'm gonna do.

11507
18:12:27,822 --> 18:12:30,063
I'm gonna slip out of these chains
and dropkick him,

11508
18:12:30,116 --> 18:12:33,028
him and him right in the throat.

11509
18:12:33,077 --> 18:12:36,114
No, not him, that's my guy.
You gotta pick another guy.

11510
18:12:36,163 --> 18:12:37,903
What do you mean that's your guy?
That's my guy.

11511
18:12:37,957 --> 18:12:41,040
No, no. That's face-smash guy.
You gotta find another dropkick guy.

11512
18:12:41,085 --> 18:12:42,996
You want a face-smash guy?
I'm gonna find you one.

11513
18:12:43,045 --> 18:12:44,455
See that guy over there?

11514
18:12:44,839 --> 18:12:47,171
The big one. The big one.

11515
18:12:47,216 --> 18:12:49,207
-That's face-smash guy.
-No, he's way too big.

11516
18:12:52,054 --> 18:12:53,260
Let 'em go.

11517
18:12:53,305 --> 18:12:57,344
All right, boys, stay calm.
We need her alive.

11518
18:12:57,393 --> 18:12:59,475
Let them go, or what?

11519
18:12:59,562 --> 18:13:02,850
Or you're gonna get a nice new breeze
there at the center of your forehead.

11520
18:13:02,940 --> 18:13:04,271
You're not gonna shoot me.

11521
18:13:05,442 --> 18:13:08,400
Because you need
an activation chip to fire that gun.

11522
18:13:08,445 --> 18:13:09,730
Sorry.

11523
18:13:09,822 --> 18:13:11,187
Try this gun!

11524
18:13:15,828 --> 18:13:17,364
I'm not small change.

11525
18:13:48,777 --> 18:13:50,483
-Let's roll.
-You think?

11526
18:13:50,529 --> 18:13:51,564
Dick.

11527
18:14:27,983 --> 18:14:29,348
There she is.

11528
18:14:36,158 --> 18:14:38,615
-Hattie, where's the machine?
-It's in the second truck.

11529
18:14:38,619 --> 18:14:40,905
On it.

11530
18:14:44,875 --> 18:14:46,240
Mick Jagger.

11531
18:14:46,293 --> 18:14:47,658
Never fails.

11532
18:14:54,969 --> 18:14:56,960
We're not out of this yet, Hattie.

11533
18:15:03,143 --> 18:15:04,633
Got the machine.

11534
18:15:10,776 --> 18:15:13,062
Get a move on!
Train's leaving the station!

11535
18:15:33,674 --> 18:15:36,336
That sumbitch really is black Superman.

11536
18:15:53,319 --> 18:15:54,729
Engage drones.

11537
18:16:08,792 --> 18:16:10,328
We're running out of road.

11538
18:16:11,545 --> 18:16:12,785
Hold on!

11539
18:16:20,721 --> 18:16:21,756
Route to intercept.

11540
18:16:48,540 --> 18:16:50,405
Whoo!

11541
18:16:58,509 --> 18:16:59,999
On your left.

11542
18:17:04,431 --> 18:17:05,511
Brace yourself.

11543
18:17:30,332 --> 18:17:32,573
Hobbs, this ain't gonna make it.

11544
18:17:33,335 --> 18:17:34,541
Bringing her to ya.

11545
18:17:34,586 --> 18:17:36,451
You thinking what I'm thinking, Shaw?

11546
18:17:36,505 --> 18:17:38,291
Let’s trade some paint.

11547
18:17:38,340 --> 18:17:39,705
Trade some paint.

11548
18:18:08,620 --> 18:18:09,655
Hattie.

11549
18:18:09,705 --> 18:18:11,286
-Huh?
-You trust me?

11550
18:19:05,469 --> 18:19:07,050
Gonna need a ride.

11551
18:19:07,095 --> 18:19:08,505
I know what you're thinking.

11552
18:19:08,555 --> 18:19:10,045
Just keep driving. I'll make it.

11553
18:19:21,818 --> 18:19:23,024
Take the wheel.

11554
18:19:37,668 --> 18:19:39,158
Ah, there he is.

11555
18:19:40,420 --> 18:19:41,580
-I got him.
-No, I got him.

11556
18:19:41,630 --> 18:19:43,040
-No, I got him.
-I got him.

11557
18:20:04,903 --> 18:20:06,268
I thought you were strong.

11558
18:21:06,632 --> 18:21:07,838
I'm sorry, brother.

11559
18:21:07,883 --> 18:21:09,839
This thing is really damaged.

11560
18:21:09,885 --> 18:21:12,171
Well, there goes option two.

11561
18:21:12,638 --> 18:21:14,754
-That only leaves the first one.
-Come on. Stop it, Hat.

11562
18:21:14,806 --> 18:21:17,047
I'm tired, Deck. I am done running.

11563
18:21:17,100 --> 18:21:19,056
-We still got time.
-"Time?"

11564
18:21:19,102 --> 18:21:20,888
Time for what? The machine's destroyed.

11565
18:21:20,937 --> 18:21:22,518
-Yeah, well, we'll ﬁx it.
-How?

11566
18:21:22,564 --> 18:21:24,054
We need to find a place
to get off the grid.

11567
18:21:24,107 --> 18:21:27,019
Where? We're wanted all over the world,
and Brixton won't stop.

11568
18:21:27,069 --> 18:21:28,229
We can't risk millions of people.

11569
18:21:28,278 --> 18:21:30,985
I told you on the plane,
we should've gone with option one.

11570
18:21:31,031 --> 18:21:32,646
-It is done now, Deck.
-It's not done.

11571
18:21:32,699 --> 18:21:34,405
-It's done.
-It's not done!

11572
18:21:37,245 --> 18:21:38,280
It's not done.

11573
18:21:41,291 --> 18:21:42,406
Look at me.

11574
18:21:42,459 --> 18:21:45,997
Remember that thing you used to say to me
when we were kids? Huh?

11575
18:21:46,046 --> 18:21:49,538
Used to look at me and say,
"Deck, it's never over till it's over."

11576
18:21:50,133 --> 18:21:52,590
We used to laugh. Remember that?

11577
18:21:53,470 --> 18:21:58,931
No, Deck, it went,
"It's never over till I say it's over."

11578
18:21:59,393 --> 18:22:01,554
Yeah, that was it.

11579
18:22:03,438 --> 18:22:05,975
So say it now. Say it.

11580
18:22:06,983 --> 18:22:08,143
Remember who we are.

11581
18:22:08,985 --> 18:22:10,316
We're the Shaw family.

11582
18:22:11,863 --> 18:22:15,321
We never, never, never give up.

11583
18:22:19,329 --> 18:22:20,444
We've got a day.

11584
18:22:22,416 --> 18:22:23,781
More than a day.

11585
18:22:24,543 --> 18:22:26,204
We don't even know where we'd go.

11586
18:22:28,588 --> 18:22:29,668
I know a place.

11587
18:22:32,342 --> 18:22:33,377
Where?

11588
18:22:33,427 --> 18:22:36,009
It's the last place on earth
I ever wanna go.

11589
18:22:39,433 --> 18:22:40,468
Home.

11590
18:23:00,454 --> 18:23:01,990
Abracadabra, bitches.

11591
18:23:02,038 --> 18:23:04,199
I told you that I could get you anything.

11592
18:23:04,249 --> 18:23:08,208
And listen to me, from Moscow to Samoa,
that is not an easy flight to charter,

11593
18:23:08,253 --> 18:23:09,368
but I got it done.

11594
18:23:09,421 --> 18:23:10,786
Well, that's why
we're calling you, Dinkley.

11595
18:23:10,839 --> 18:23:13,672
We just wanted to say thank you
for getting us that bird to Samoa.

11596
18:23:13,717 --> 18:23:15,127
Warriors help out warriors.

11597
18:23:15,177 --> 18:23:18,385
So all you need to know
is that you got a third squaddie over here

11598
18:23:18,430 --> 18:23:21,137
that is ready to go
whenever you need me to.

11599
18:23:21,183 --> 18:23:23,139
-I'm just sitting in my lair.

11600
18:23:24,644 --> 18:23:25,759
You in a bathroom?

11601
18:23:25,812 --> 18:23:27,052
Potato, potah-to.

11602
18:23:27,105 --> 18:23:30,518
Wherever I am is where the magic happens.
We ain't gotta get into specifics.

11603
18:23:30,567 --> 18:23:32,273
Just to make sure
you got all the contacts.

11604
18:23:32,319 --> 18:23:35,186
You got the cell, you got my e-mail.

11605
18:23:35,238 --> 18:23:36,569
-Got 'em all.
-I'ma shoot you

11606
18:23:36,615 --> 18:23:37,730
my mom number too.

11607
18:23:37,783 --> 18:23:40,775
I'ma make sure you got that,
'cause if you can't get me, she can.

11608
18:23:40,827 --> 18:23:43,819
I got a Hotmail address
that’s still active. Hit me on that.

11609
18:23:43,872 --> 18:23:46,204
LinkedIn. That's my profile.

11610
18:23:46,249 --> 18:23:47,830
-...account thing I've been doing.

11611
18:23:47,876 --> 18:23:50,242
-I'm just making sure you got everything--
-We're losing ya.

11612
18:23:52,798 --> 18:23:53,913
That was my phone.

11613
18:23:55,759 --> 18:23:59,593
I hope this brother of yours
is as good a mechanic as you say he is.

11614
18:23:59,638 --> 18:24:03,096
Jonah is the best mechanic I know.
And he's gonna help us.

11615
18:24:03,141 --> 18:24:04,597
That is, if he doesn't kill me first.

11616
18:24:23,203 --> 18:24:24,238
Yeah, take your time.

11617
18:24:24,287 --> 18:24:27,529
It's only my sister's life and
the fate of the world we're waiting on!

11618
18:24:30,836 --> 18:24:31,871
Oh, here we go.

11619
18:24:31,920 --> 18:24:34,787
Bet you a bullseye 50 quid
he punches him in the face.

11620
18:24:34,840 --> 18:24:35,875
Deal.

11621
18:24:48,603 --> 18:24:50,059
Jonah.

11622
18:24:51,523 --> 18:24:53,059
You know what comes next?

11623
18:24:53,817 --> 18:24:54,852
Yup.

11624
18:24:58,572 --> 18:25:00,608
See? Not just me.

11625
18:25:02,784 --> 18:25:05,571
Your face,
it's all over the bloody news, boy.

11626
18:25:05,620 --> 18:25:07,110
You're not welcome here, police.

11627
18:25:07,163 --> 18:25:08,494
You got a bloody cheek.

11628
18:25:08,540 --> 18:25:13,250
Coming here after 25 years.
Bringing your problems here to this house.

11629
18:25:13,295 --> 18:25:16,253
You betrayed our family,
bring shame on our house.

11630
18:25:16,298 --> 18:25:17,708
You betrayed your own blood!

11631
18:25:19,467 --> 18:25:21,003
Jonah, I hear you.

11632
18:25:21,553 --> 18:25:23,635
But we ain't kids anymore.
You better watch how you talk to me.

11633
18:25:23,680 --> 18:25:26,137
It's not the size of the dog
in the fight, boy.

11634
18:25:26,182 --> 18:25:27,718
It's the size of the fight in the dog.

11635
18:25:27,767 --> 18:25:30,600
No, it's always the size of the dog.

11636
18:25:31,354 --> 18:25:34,767
Hey! No fighting under this roof, huh?

11637
18:25:35,942 --> 18:25:39,400
Is that my Luke? Oka...

11638
18:25:40,155 --> 18:25:41,895
My baby's home.

11639
18:25:43,325 --> 18:25:44,405
Hey, Mama.

11640
18:25:45,327 --> 18:25:47,909
Oka, I miss my baby boy.

11641
18:25:48,455 --> 18:25:51,197
But look at you, all skin and bones.

11642
18:25:51,249 --> 18:25:53,661
-Come over here and eat.
-No, no, no, Mama.

11643
18:25:54,085 --> 18:25:55,325
There's no time.

11644
18:25:56,004 --> 18:25:57,494
I'm sorry. I didn't want
to bring trouble here.

11645
18:25:57,547 --> 18:26:00,209
You should've stayed away.
What did you bring here?

11646
18:26:00,258 --> 18:26:01,794
-I brought the truth here.
-What truth?

11647
18:26:01,843 --> 18:26:03,049
The truth is we were set up.

11648
18:26:03,094 --> 18:26:05,301
We were framed by people
who created a deadly virus.

11649
18:26:05,347 --> 18:26:08,134
-Oh, come on.
-It could go global if it's not stopped.

11650
18:26:08,183 --> 18:26:09,923
We could all die. All of us.

11651
18:26:09,976 --> 18:26:12,058
Everybody here in this fale,
everybody on the island.

11652
18:26:12,103 --> 18:26:13,513
And everybody around the world.

11653
18:26:13,563 --> 18:26:15,645
Jonah, I need you
to help ﬁx this machine.

11654
18:26:15,690 --> 18:26:17,055
I need you to help my friends,

11655
18:26:17,108 --> 18:26:19,599
and I need us
to build defenses around here, now!

11656
18:26:19,653 --> 18:26:22,190
You think you can just come back in here
and we're gonna help you

11657
18:26:22,238 --> 18:26:23,603
-after everything you did?
-Yes!

11658
18:26:23,657 --> 18:26:25,067
-Not gonna happen!
-It's bigger than you and I!

11659
18:26:25,116 --> 18:26:27,402
-I don't care!
-It's bigger than you and I! We could die.

11660
18:26:27,452 --> 18:26:31,070
Good, because I would rather die
than help you, polo head!

11661
18:26:31,122 --> 18:26:34,910
Listen, I know your brother's
hard to be around, believe me.

11662
18:26:34,960 --> 18:26:36,825
But I trust him, and he brought us here

11663
18:26:36,878 --> 18:26:41,292
because this place has something
that nowhere else on the planet does: you.

11664
18:26:41,341 --> 18:26:43,753
You don't know me! I don't know you, okay?

11665
18:26:43,802 --> 18:26:46,885
Time for you all to go.
Take your machine with you. Go, now!

11666
18:26:46,930 --> 18:26:49,546
-Go!
-Jonah Hobbs!

11667
18:26:49,975 --> 18:26:52,307
You have some respect for your use.

11668
18:26:52,352 --> 18:26:54,809
If he needs anything,
we gonna give it to him.

11669
18:26:54,854 --> 18:26:58,312
The food off our tables,
the clothes off our backs,

11670
18:26:59,067 --> 18:27:01,308
even the mana of the islands.

11671
18:27:01,361 --> 18:27:07,823
And you boys, all you boys,
you show our guests here fa'aaloalo,

11672
18:27:07,867 --> 18:27:12,281
or so help me God,
I'm gonna take this here slipper

11673
18:27:12,330 --> 18:27:14,992
and I'm gonna sasa your big, fat heads!

11674
18:27:15,041 --> 18:27:16,247
You boys hear me?

11675
18:27:17,502 --> 18:27:19,493
I'm sorry to bring this here, Mama.

11676
18:27:19,546 --> 18:27:21,878
Luke, this is your home.

11677
18:27:22,340 --> 18:27:26,003
We Samoans. We can handle troubles.

11678
18:27:39,899 --> 18:27:44,268
You were right.
You don 't turn soldiers like them.

11679
18:27:45,989 --> 18:27:51,074
Do what I built you to do.
You're a one-of-a-kind war machine.

11680
18:27:52,954 --> 18:27:54,615
Bring us back my virus.

11681
18:27:55,665 --> 18:27:57,496
No handcuffs this time.

11682
18:27:59,002 --> 18:28:00,583
You can have your revenge.

11683
18:28:02,213 --> 18:28:03,293
I will.

11684
18:28:04,215 --> 18:28:06,706
We found 'em.
They hopped an unregistered cargo plane.

11685
18:28:06,760 --> 18:28:08,591
-To where?
-Samoa.

11686
18:28:08,636 --> 18:28:11,844
Gentlemen!
This is where you earn your upgrades.

11687
18:28:12,599 --> 18:28:13,964
Bring me back my virus.

11688
18:28:30,116 --> 18:28:31,196
Yeah.

11689
18:28:40,794 --> 18:28:42,659
It's quite the operation.

11690
18:28:42,712 --> 18:28:45,124
Yeah, for a chop shop.

11691
18:28:45,173 --> 18:28:46,583
Your dad was a car thief, then?

11692
18:28:46,633 --> 18:28:49,841
No. My dad actually stole everything.

11693
18:28:49,886 --> 18:28:52,002
Drugs. Guns...

11694
18:28:52,055 --> 18:28:53,920
Sounds just like my family.

11695
18:28:53,973 --> 18:28:55,929
Mama raised us till we were teenagers,

11696
18:28:55,975 --> 18:28:58,341
and my old man
started coming around again.

11697
18:28:58,394 --> 18:29:00,601
Taking a real interest in his sons.

11698
18:29:00,647 --> 18:29:03,104
The truth is,
he was just looking for a new crew.

11699
18:29:04,067 --> 18:29:06,399
And I was the only one
to see through those lies.

11700
18:29:10,156 --> 18:29:13,523
So the jobs my dad pulled
me and my brothers into

11701
18:29:13,576 --> 18:29:16,192
just got bigger and more dangerous.

11702
18:29:17,580 --> 18:29:18,695
Then eventually he knew,

11703
18:29:18,748 --> 18:29:22,661
and he was okay with,
getting me and my brothers killed.

11704
18:29:24,712 --> 18:29:26,077
So I turned him in.

11705
18:29:26,131 --> 18:29:28,213
Or you protected your family.

11706
18:29:31,845 --> 18:29:36,054
So after I put him away,
I left Samoa and I never came back.

11707
18:29:36,099 --> 18:29:39,842
Well, at least one good thing came out
of me jamming that thing into my hand.

11708
18:29:40,353 --> 18:29:41,593
Yeah, what's that?

11709
18:29:42,147 --> 18:29:44,354
Got to bring you home, didn't I?

11710
18:29:48,611 --> 18:29:50,021
Lucky me.

11711
18:29:56,452 --> 18:29:57,862
You went legit.

11712
18:29:57,912 --> 18:30:00,073
Yeah, 100% clean now.

11713
18:30:00,123 --> 18:30:02,079
Custom shop, international clients.

11714
18:30:02,542 --> 18:30:04,328
See those bikes? Going to Tokyo.

11715
18:30:04,377 --> 18:30:07,585
And that car? New York.
That one over there's going to London.

11716
18:30:07,630 --> 18:30:09,166
Turns out people like our stuff.

11717
18:30:10,133 --> 18:30:12,749
I needed to do something
to hold our family together.

11718
18:30:14,179 --> 18:30:15,544
After you abandoned us.

11719
18:30:20,435 --> 18:30:23,393
Hey, good news. Change of clothes. Hats.

11720
18:30:24,856 --> 18:30:26,687
Your mum said you might like to wear this.

11721
18:30:26,733 --> 18:30:29,315
Must be your favorite size. Spray on.

11722
18:30:30,737 --> 18:30:33,729
Why don't you throw another jacket on?
It's 110 degrees out there.

11723
18:30:33,781 --> 18:30:37,194
Hey, look, down to business.
We got any weapons?

11724
18:30:38,870 --> 18:30:40,110
Oh, we got weapons.

11725
18:30:48,046 --> 18:30:49,536
Mama, where's all our guns?

11726
18:30:49,589 --> 18:30:50,704
I get rid of 'em.

11727
18:30:52,091 --> 18:30:53,501
Very noble, Mrs. Hobbs.

11728
18:30:54,844 --> 18:30:55,879
We're in serious trouble.

11729
18:30:55,929 --> 18:30:57,715
That is an understatement.

11730
18:30:57,764 --> 18:31:01,848
These guns, they kill all my family.

11731
18:31:02,810 --> 18:31:04,175
So we gonna ﬁght.

11732
18:31:04,229 --> 18:31:07,437
Gonna fight with this
and we gonna fight with this.

11733
18:31:08,191 --> 18:31:11,308
'Cause no take a real man
for pull one trigger.

11734
18:31:11,361 --> 18:31:14,819
All right, we're going to war
with the family heirlooms.

11735
18:31:14,864 --> 18:31:17,025
Got it. We're gonna need a lot more.

11736
18:31:17,075 --> 18:31:19,031
We're never gonna survive their ﬁrepower.

11737
18:31:19,077 --> 18:31:21,614
It doesn't take a man to pull a trigger,

11738
18:31:21,663 --> 18:31:23,449
but for Eteon,
it does take an activation chip.

11739
18:31:23,498 --> 18:31:24,863
You still got that glove?

11740
18:31:25,250 --> 18:31:26,581
You're thinking closed-system hack.

11741
18:31:26,626 --> 18:31:28,332
It'll level the playing ﬁeld if you can.

11742
18:31:28,378 --> 18:31:29,709
Certainly buy us some time.

11743
18:31:29,754 --> 18:31:30,914
Shut their guns down.

11744
18:31:30,964 --> 18:31:32,204
I'm on it.

11745
18:31:33,591 --> 18:31:34,626
You ready?

11746
18:31:37,220 --> 18:31:38,676
War is what I do.

11747
18:31:39,889 --> 18:31:41,550
Let's go old-school.

11748
18:31:42,725 --> 18:31:44,056
Take a look around.

11749
18:31:44,894 --> 18:31:46,555
This is where we draw the line.

11750
18:31:47,105 --> 18:31:49,596
Who would've thought this is where
we're gonna save the world?

11751
18:31:50,108 --> 18:31:52,269
We need to make 'em play by our rules.

11752
18:31:52,318 --> 18:31:55,151
Tomorrow morning there I] be a storm
raging on the north cliffs.

11753
18:31:55,196 --> 18:31:56,902
We'll build a no-man’s-land there.

11754
18:31:56,906 --> 18:32:00,364
And if all else fails,
that'll be our last stand.

11755
18:32:01,160 --> 18:32:03,321
How many more of these we gotta do?

11756
18:32:04,998 --> 18:32:06,329
Just keep digging, brother.

11757
18:32:07,000 --> 18:32:09,161
When we were in Kandahar running raids,

11758
18:32:09,210 --> 18:32:11,826
Brixton would always strike
just before dawn.

11759
18:32:11,879 --> 18:32:15,212
It's when the enemy's most tired,
still under the cover of night.

11760
18:32:16,175 --> 18:32:19,508
When the battle shifts into high gear,
you got the sun at your back.

11761
18:32:19,554 --> 18:32:22,842
We let 'em all in.
And we make sure they never leave.

11762
18:32:22,890 --> 18:32:27,133
Kill box. I like it.
Not like we got a ton of resources.

11763
18:32:28,146 --> 18:32:30,262
But the island will provide, brother.

11764
18:34:10,415 --> 18:34:12,906
-Give me the good news, Hat.
-I'm in.

11765
18:34:12,959 --> 18:34:15,701
The only thing is, I could only block
the signal repeaters on the satellite

11766
18:34:15,753 --> 18:34:16,868
for six minutes.

11767
18:34:16,921 --> 18:34:21,335
Six minutes might be all the time we need.
Better than a sharp stick in the eye.

11768
18:34:21,384 --> 18:34:24,251
Which is basically
all we've got to fight them with anyway.

11769
18:34:24,303 --> 18:34:26,043
Done more with less, haven't we?

11770
18:34:43,865 --> 18:34:44,945
Hi.

11771
18:34:46,993 --> 18:34:49,985
-Drink?
-Sure. Thank you.

11772
18:34:54,208 --> 18:34:57,371
Just taking it all in,
in case it's the last sunset we see.

11773
18:35:04,510 --> 18:35:06,967
I shouldn't have believed
that Deckard went dark.

11774
18:35:12,518 --> 18:35:16,557
Wasted so much time. I'm...

11775
18:35:21,777 --> 18:35:25,486
I've spent my whole life running away.

11776
18:35:26,240 --> 18:35:28,572
-Me too.
-Yeah?

11777
18:35:30,119 --> 18:35:31,154
Yeah.

11778
18:35:33,498 --> 18:35:34,988
I haven't been back here in 25 years.

11779
18:35:35,041 --> 18:35:37,703
I mean, my own daughter
doesn't even know her family.

11780
18:35:39,545 --> 18:35:43,254
Well... you can change that.

11781
18:35:48,137 --> 18:35:49,172
Yeah.

11782
18:35:50,306 --> 18:35:51,512
So can you.

11783
18:35:52,934 --> 18:35:56,552
I got an idea. Why don't you and I
make a promise right here, right now?

11784
18:35:56,604 --> 18:36:01,689
That when we see tomorrow's sunset,
we begin to fix the mistakes we've made.

11785
18:36:12,286 --> 18:36:14,902
That's just sealed it
so you can't back out. That's all.

11786
18:36:18,918 --> 18:36:21,830
I don't think there's any chance in hell
I would back out.

11787
18:36:22,922 --> 18:36:24,662
You wanna seal it again or...

11788
18:36:24,715 --> 18:36:26,171
-Deﬁnitely not.
-Okay.

11789
18:36:26,801 --> 18:36:28,462
Maybe tomorrow, if I survive.

11790
18:36:31,389 --> 18:36:32,925
-Jonah.
-Look, don't rush me.

11791
18:36:32,974 --> 18:36:35,556
It's almost dawn. He'll be here soon.

11792
18:36:35,601 --> 18:36:37,637
Make it happen now! Now!


11793
18:36:37,687 --> 18:36:39,973
Hey, don't rush me.
That's how mistakes are made.

11794
18:36:40,022 --> 18:36:42,013
And how long does this process take?

11795
18:36:42,066 --> 18:36:44,273
It's 30 minutes and 33 till I go viral.

11796
18:36:44,318 --> 18:36:46,775
Deck, I think we need to
seriously consider option one.

11797
18:36:46,821 --> 18:36:48,686
Don't strike a match just yet, Hats.

11798
18:36:48,739 --> 18:36:50,525
We are seriously gonna miss this window.

11799
18:36:50,575 --> 18:36:52,816
-Let's do this. Come on!
-Jonah, now!

11800
18:36:52,868 --> 18:36:56,110
Fine, fine, okay. Here goes nothing.

11801
18:36:56,789 --> 18:36:58,700
Brace yourself, Hats.

11802
18:36:59,917 --> 18:37:02,954
-It ain't gonna be pleasant.
-No, it's gonna be fine.

11803
18:37:17,893 --> 18:37:19,599
It's working. It's working.

11804
18:37:19,645 --> 18:37:21,351
Yeah.

11805
18:37:21,397 --> 18:37:22,682
Yeah!

11806
18:37:27,528 --> 18:37:29,189
Hey. They triggered the alarm!

11807
18:37:29,697 --> 18:37:30,732
That's him.

11808
18:37:31,449 --> 18:37:33,781
-As we planned?
-As we planned.

11809
18:37:34,243 --> 18:37:35,528
Usos!

11810
18:37:37,997 --> 18:37:39,032
It's time.

11811
18:37:43,127 --> 18:37:44,367
Jonah.

11812
18:37:49,258 --> 18:37:50,748
Just wanna say that...

11813
18:37:52,136 --> 18:37:53,797
if this thing goes sideways and...

11814
18:37:55,348 --> 18:37:56,508
and this is it...

11815
18:37:59,894 --> 18:38:00,929
I'm sorry.

11816
18:38:03,314 --> 18:38:05,680
I may have had my reasons,
but the fact is...

11817
18:38:08,736 --> 18:38:11,227
I left you and I left our 'aiga.

11818
18:38:16,035 --> 18:38:17,400
I should've come home.

11819
18:38:18,704 --> 18:38:20,569
If we make it through this,

11820
18:38:20,623 --> 18:38:22,909
you have my word
I'll never let that happen again.

11821
18:38:26,754 --> 18:38:27,789
I love you, uso.

11822
18:38:36,305 --> 18:38:37,465
I love you too, uso.

11823
18:38:44,939 --> 18:38:47,430
Okay, you're mobile.

11824
18:38:50,861 --> 18:38:52,772
Do you think I need to be so close
to the front line?

11825
18:38:52,822 --> 18:38:54,858
Yeah, we keep you close.
Keep an eye on you

11826
18:38:54,949 --> 18:38:56,735
in case we need to make a quick getaway.

11827
18:38:56,784 --> 18:38:58,570
Hey, this is what we do, right?

11828
18:38:59,954 --> 18:39:01,569
It is what we do.

11829
18:39:03,582 --> 18:39:04,742
Deck...

11830
18:39:08,796 --> 18:39:10,661
I overheard what Brixton said.

11831
18:39:13,175 --> 18:39:15,166
That you stayed away to protect us.

11832
18:39:17,680 --> 18:39:20,547
I never should've believed all that stuff,
I know it now.

11833
18:39:22,643 --> 18:39:25,476
-I don't know why I did. I'm so sorry.
-Don't be.

11834
18:39:26,689 --> 18:39:31,934
Don't be. Hey, look, I've done things,
done things I'm not proud of.

11835
18:39:33,154 --> 18:39:36,817
Things I... have to make amends for.

11836
18:39:36,866 --> 18:39:39,448
All thanks to what that bastard
put me through.

11837
18:39:40,619 --> 18:39:43,486
But right now,
the most important thing to me

11838
18:39:43,539 --> 18:39:45,495
is getting my little sister home safely.

11839
18:40:16,947 --> 18:40:18,437
Eteon, hold!

11840
18:41:00,241 --> 18:41:02,197
-Do it.
-Light 'em up.

11841
18:41:06,580 --> 18:41:08,787
What's going on?

11842
18:41:11,085 --> 18:41:13,041
How long before the guns get back online?

11843
18:41:13,087 --> 18:41:14,327
I've no idea.

11844
18:41:44,577 --> 18:41:45,987
Shaw.

11845
18:41:51,375 --> 18:41:52,535
Air command.

11846
18:41:54,253 --> 18:41:55,493
Bring me the chopper.

11847
18:43:06,492 --> 18:43:07,572
Deck!

11848
18:43:26,428 --> 18:43:28,009
Do it quick, Hats.

11849
18:43:28,055 --> 18:43:30,637
-It's in, it's in, it's in. Is it working?
-Machine's on.

11850
18:43:32,977 --> 18:43:34,092
-We're good.
-We're good.

11851
18:43:34,144 --> 18:43:35,179
Let's go.

11852
18:44:46,341 --> 18:44:47,922
Hobbs!

11853
18:45:11,158 --> 18:45:12,523
Go, go!

11854
18:45:16,080 --> 18:45:17,445
Let's go fishing, Shaw.

11855
18:45:17,498 --> 18:45:19,580
You catch him, I'll gut him.

11856
18:45:25,214 --> 18:45:26,704
Hold on!

11857
18:45:48,362 --> 18:45:50,444
-Welcome to my island, you--
-Take it up!

11858
18:46:03,627 --> 18:46:05,788
You get us close and I'll get her.

11859
18:46:05,838 --> 18:46:08,250
I'll keep his nose down. You reel him in.

11860
18:46:17,933 --> 18:46:19,639
Take it up! Take it up!

11861
18:46:29,278 --> 18:46:30,358
Have a day off.

11862
18:46:47,296 --> 18:46:48,581
What are you doing?

11863
18:46:48,630 --> 18:46:50,166
We're going for a ride.

11864
18:46:55,637 --> 18:46:57,047
Shit.

11865
18:46:57,097 --> 18:46:59,713
We're coming, usos!

11866
18:47:05,606 --> 18:47:08,222
-Let's go, Jonah.
-Come on, brother.

11867
18:47:09,818 --> 18:47:11,399
The axle, the axle!

11868
18:47:30,297 --> 18:47:31,628
Timo, you got this!

11869
18:47:37,721 --> 18:47:39,257
Ah!

11870
18:47:46,021 --> 18:47:47,227
We're gonna need more weight.

11871
18:47:47,272 --> 18:47:51,231
Yeah!

11872
18:47:58,992 --> 18:48:00,948
Bring it in nice and easy, clean.

11873
18:48:04,122 --> 18:48:05,987
Hell yeah, usos!

11874
18:48:08,669 --> 18:48:10,705
-It's too much weight!
-All right, drop 'em.

11875
18:48:21,515 --> 18:48:22,550
Stay there!

11876
18:48:28,397 --> 18:48:30,854
Hit 'em with the moonshine! Now!

11877
18:48:57,134 --> 18:48:59,591
Hang me off a cliff, huh? My turn.

11878
18:49:03,015 --> 18:49:04,630
Sir, the weapons

11879
18:49:04,683 --> 18:49:06,719
-are back online.
-Let's go, let's go!

11880
18:49:08,395 --> 18:49:10,135
-Goodbye.

11881
18:49:10,981 --> 18:49:12,767
Incoming!

11882
18:49:22,492 --> 18:49:24,278
We got a little trouble back here, Shaw.

11883
18:49:24,328 --> 18:49:26,034
We'll lose 'em in no-man's-land.

11884
18:49:38,884 --> 18:49:39,999
Let's get this up!

11885
18:49:57,402 --> 18:49:58,767
All right, now hit that stake.

11886
18:50:13,543 --> 18:50:14,578
We're losing the rotor!

11887
18:50:16,546 --> 18:50:17,661
Shit.

11888
18:50:23,011 --> 18:50:24,046
What the--

11889
18:50:26,306 --> 18:50:27,671
I got you, Hobbs.

11890
18:50:35,315 --> 18:50:36,521
Hey!

11891
18:50:42,572 --> 18:50:44,733
-The rotor!
-Losing power.

11892
18:50:47,202 --> 18:50:49,067
Guys!

11893
18:50:49,121 --> 18:50:50,736
Hattie! Jump!

11894
18:51:42,841 --> 18:51:45,048
Hey, get up. Get up!

11895
18:51:45,552 --> 18:51:47,088
Hey! Get up!

11896
18:51:47,512 --> 18:51:49,798
You don't die until I tell you to die.

11897
18:51:49,848 --> 18:51:51,384
You see the extraction timer?

11898
18:51:51,433 --> 18:51:55,597
When it hits zero, empty this clip
into her heart, do you understand?

11899
18:52:06,323 --> 18:52:07,358
Hattie!

11900
18:52:10,994 --> 18:52:13,110
This doesn't end your way, boys.

11901
18:52:13,163 --> 18:52:15,154
Yeah, you keep telling yourself that.

11902
18:52:15,207 --> 18:52:18,040
The numbers don't add up for you.

11903
18:52:18,543 --> 18:52:21,660
The evolution of man is coming,
whether you like it or not.

11904
18:52:24,591 --> 18:52:26,752
You know, I almost feel bad for you.

11905
18:52:26,843 --> 18:52:29,209
'Cause it's not just metal
they ﬁlled your head with.

11906
18:52:29,262 --> 18:52:30,843
It's bullshit.

11907
18:52:33,141 --> 18:52:35,507
I was beginning to like you two,
you know that?

11908
18:52:37,103 --> 18:52:38,468
Oh, well.

11909
18:53:13,932 --> 18:53:16,344
What's the problem, boys? Does it hurt?

11910
18:53:17,352 --> 18:53:21,095
Must be hard being so... human.

11911
18:53:51,720 --> 18:53:52,926
-Did you see that?
-Yeah.

11912
18:53:53,013 --> 18:53:55,675
-We work together, we can hurt him.
-You're right.

11913
18:53:56,266 --> 18:53:58,882
-Time to work as a team.
-There's two of us and one of him.

11914
18:53:58,935 --> 18:54:02,177
-I'll take a punch and let you land one.
-I'll do the same.

11915
18:54:03,398 --> 18:54:04,513
I got your back, brother.

11916
18:54:04,566 --> 18:54:06,022
And I got yours.

11917
18:54:06,610 --> 18:54:08,225
Let's go unplug this sumbitch.

11918
18:56:00,807 --> 18:56:02,468
Here comes the kryptonite.

11919
18:56:18,158 --> 18:56:19,193
I got it.

11920
18:56:19,826 --> 18:56:20,986
You did it, Hat.

11921
18:56:21,411 --> 18:56:22,617
Never had a doubt.

11922
18:56:24,289 --> 18:56:25,870
Let's get it into safe hands.

11923
18:56:32,088 --> 18:56:33,624
You set me up as a traitor.

11924
18:56:35,383 --> 18:56:37,749
Turned my own sister against me.

11925
18:56:38,720 --> 18:56:42,884
Forced me to kill my own brother. You.

11926
18:56:42,891 --> 18:56:45,177
And here we are again. Come on!

11927
18:56:46,895 --> 18:56:48,886
Shaw, compared to the cause...

11928
18:56:52,317 --> 18:56:54,353
one life doesn't mean anything.

11929
18:56:54,778 --> 18:56:56,484
I don't know what
happened to you, Brixton.

11930
18:56:59,824 --> 18:57:01,405
But you made me kill you once.

11931
18:57:03,912 --> 18:57:05,243
I ain't doing it again.

11932
18:57:10,585 --> 18:57:12,792
Brother, you may believe in machines...

11933
18:57:14,380 --> 18:57:15,586
but we believe in people.

11934
18:57:24,098 --> 18:57:26,305
You may have all the technology
in the world.

11935
18:57:30,480 --> 18:57:31,686
We have heart.

11936
18:57:33,566 --> 18:57:36,558
No machine will ever beat that.

11937
18:57:38,530 --> 18:57:42,648
You boys, you're gonna get
one Samoan ass-whupping.

11938
18:57:51,626 --> 18:57:54,333
Shut Brixton down.

11939
18:58:02,387 --> 18:58:03,843
So that's how it is?

11940
18:58:07,892 --> 18:58:09,974
It's a hell of a business, boys.

11941
18:58:27,996 --> 18:58:31,113
Brixton never really lived up
to our expectations.

11942
18:58:32,166 --> 18:58:36,034
But you three,
you outperformed your analytics.

11943
18:58:37,255 --> 18:58:39,587
You don't remember me, do you, Hobbs?

11944
18:58:41,175 --> 18:58:42,210
You will.

11945
18:58:43,303 --> 18:58:45,089
It's gonna be a hell of a reunion.

11946
18:58:47,223 --> 18:58:48,963
You’re on our radar now.

11947
18:58:50,351 --> 18:58:51,636
And you're on ours.

11948
18:59:00,862 --> 18:59:03,444
Hey, thanks for being my sidekick
through this whole thing, brother.

11949
18:59:03,489 --> 18:59:04,854
You were great.

11950
18:59:04,908 --> 18:59:06,990
Hey, how 'bout I side-kick
that stupid look off your face?

11951
18:59:07,035 --> 18:59:08,616
Yeah? How 'bout you show me right now?

11952
18:59:08,661 --> 18:59:09,946
Okay, guys.

11953
18:59:10,580 --> 18:59:11,786
Let's go home.

11954
18:59:14,751 --> 18:59:16,036
-Yeah.
-All right.

11955
18:59:17,670 --> 18:59:21,083
Look, Batman had Robin.
Dr. Evil had Mini-Me. You're my Mini-Me.

11956
18:59:21,132 --> 18:59:23,589
Han Solo had Chewbacca.
Kermit had Miss Piggy.

11957
18:59:23,635 --> 18:59:24,966
That's a low blow. Don't say that.

11958
18:59:25,011 --> 18:59:26,842
Don't argue with me on my island.
You're my sidekick.

11959
19:00:27,532 --> 19:00:30,148
I'm so happy you're back.

11960
19:00:31,911 --> 19:00:33,776
Brought you that cake you wanted.

11961
19:00:35,331 --> 19:00:36,616
I wouldn't eat it.

11962
19:00:39,836 --> 19:00:41,292
Let's get out of here.

11963
19:00:48,553 --> 19:00:50,339
How long have you been working here?

11964
19:00:52,849 --> 19:00:55,591
Sam, this is your grandma.

11965
19:01:01,607 --> 19:01:05,850
I love you.

11966
19:01:09,866 --> 19:01:11,481
Good to have you home, uso.

11967
19:01:12,243 --> 19:01:13,904
It's good to be home, uso.

11968
19:01:31,800 --> 19:01:34,883
Hobbs. I hope you're sitting down,
buddy, because we got big problems.

11969
19:01:34,928 --> 19:01:37,340
God. I feel immediately better
just talking to you.

11970
19:01:37,389 --> 19:01:38,424
Is that weird?

11971
19:01:38,473 --> 19:01:41,681
Anyway, look.
The Snowﬂake virus, totally ﬁne.

11972
19:01:41,726 --> 19:01:43,682
On lockdown. In a secure asset vault.

11973
19:01:43,728 --> 19:01:48,848
But what we're dealing with
right now... is another virus.

11974
19:01:48,900 --> 19:01:52,358
The last one, well, that melted
your insides, but this one...

11975
19:01:53,113 --> 19:01:55,775
melts your outsides. Literally.

11976
19:01:55,824 --> 19:01:59,442
Your skin drips off. It's like removing
a silk kimono in a hurricane.

11977
19:01:59,911 --> 19:02:04,371
It's so gross. The point is
we need to get on this, like, now.

11978
19:02:04,416 --> 19:02:06,247
I need both of you.

11979
19:02:06,293 --> 19:02:07,373
What do you say, Becky?

11980
19:02:07,419 --> 19:02:08,829
Hey, Locke. This is Sam.

11981
19:02:08,879 --> 19:02:10,744
-Sam?
-You must wanna talk to my dad.

11982
19:02:10,797 --> 19:02:12,333
Oh, my God. Sam.

11983
19:02:13,216 --> 19:02:17,880
Wow! You sound exactly like your dad.

11984
19:02:18,305 --> 19:02:22,218
It's freaking me out right now.
It's like listening to a mirror.

11985
19:02:22,893 --> 19:02:24,929
-Can you put Hobbs on?
-I'm on.

11986
19:02:24,978 --> 19:02:27,185
I know, but I need
to speak to Hobbs, sweetie.

11987
19:02:27,230 --> 19:02:29,016
I'm on. What do you want?

11988
19:02:29,065 --> 19:02:32,057
I mean, seriously, record yourself
side by-- It's crazy.

11989
19:02:32,110 --> 19:02:35,068
Before you say another word,
tell me you took care of the Snowflake.

11990
19:02:35,113 --> 19:02:38,276
I got it. It's done. We're good, okay?
'Cause I care about people.

11991
19:02:38,325 --> 19:02:40,236
-I care about our family.
-You are not family.

11992
19:02:40,285 --> 19:02:43,368
I know. What we have is so much deeper.
Listen, hey, real talk...

11993
19:02:43,955 --> 19:02:45,820
Can you believe
that Game of Thrones ending?

11994
19:02:45,874 --> 19:02:46,863
I didn't see it.

11995
19:02:46,917 --> 19:02:50,501
You watched the shit out of it,
you dirty little liar.

11996
19:02:50,545 --> 19:02:52,285
What's the problem?
You said there was a problem.

11997
19:02:52,339 --> 19:02:56,924
My problem is that Jon Snow
had sex with his aunt, then killed her,

11998
19:02:56,968 --> 19:02:59,459
and nobody wants to talk about it.
That's what my problem is.

11999
19:02:59,512 --> 19:03:02,470
Jesus. Hang on a second here.

12000
19:03:03,000 --> 19:03:04,080
Are you okay?

12001
19:03:04,126 --> 19:03:06,287
Okay.

12002
19:03:07,463 --> 19:03:09,795
I'm definitely wounded now, so...

12003
19:03:09,840 --> 19:03:11,876
I'm gonna really need
that extraction, Big Papa.

12004
19:03:11,926 --> 19:03:13,962
I'll tell you what, sit tight.
I'm coming to get you.

12005
19:03:14,011 --> 19:03:16,673
Also, if you didn't mind, you could
bring a couple of pints of blood as well.

12006
19:03:16,722 --> 19:03:19,008
-Locke--
-Don't you wanna know my blood type?

12007
19:03:19,058 --> 19:03:20,719
What's your blood type?

12008
19:03:20,768 --> 19:03:23,851
It's B-positive.
Just like my life outlook.

12009
19:03:23,896 --> 19:03:26,182
-Imagine that.
-Locke.

12010
19:03:26,899 --> 19:03:28,435
-Locke?
-Jesus, I'm bleeding a lot.

12011
19:03:28,484 --> 19:03:30,725
God. I'm bleeding so, so much right now.

12012
19:03:31,404 --> 19:03:34,362
Oh, no. Actually, wait,
hold on a second. That's not my blood.

12013
19:03:34,407 --> 19:03:35,613
That's not my blood.

12014
19:03:36,284 --> 19:03:37,899
Oh, God, I thought that was me!

12015
19:03:37,952 --> 19:03:38,987
By the way,

12016
19:03:39,036 --> 19:03:42,324
I stabbed a guy with a brick.

12017
19:03:42,373 --> 19:03:43,579
How crazy is that?

12018
19:03:43,624 --> 19:03:45,660
Turns out, it's not that hard.

12019
19:03:56,500 --> 19:03:57,865
Let me guess.

12020
19:03:57,918 --> 19:03:59,704
You have a mission to save the world.

12021
19:03:59,753 --> 19:04:01,209
You just can't do it without me.

12022
19:04:01,255 --> 19:04:03,166
No, man.

12023
19:04:03,215 --> 19:04:06,548
I was just checking in on you.
Seeing how my good friend is doing.

12024
19:04:07,469 --> 19:04:08,629
And I...

12025
19:04:09,722 --> 19:04:11,178
I really wanted to hear this.

12026
19:04:11,640 --> 19:04:14,757
Police! Come out with your hands up!

12027
19:04:14,810 --> 19:04:17,597
We know you’re in there, Hugh Janus.

12028
19:04:18,897 --> 19:04:20,057
You bastard.

12029
19:04:21,317 --> 19:04:23,558
I warned you, you bald-headed sumbitch.

12030
19:04:24,028 --> 19:04:27,236
When you least expect it... expect it.

12031
19:04:27,281 --> 19:04:29,192
You have no idea what you've just started.

12032
19:04:29,241 --> 19:04:31,903
Well, I'm pretty sure it involves
rubber gloves and a body cavity search.

12033
19:04:32,661 --> 19:04:33,821
Not a chance.

12034
19:04:38,083 --> 19:04:40,540
-Police!
-Get on the ground, Hugh Janus!

12035
19:04:40,586 --> 19:04:43,043
This ain't gonna go down
how you boys expect.

12036
19:04:44,923 --> 19:04:46,333
I'll be seeing you, Hobbs.

12037
19:04:48,427 --> 19:04:49,792
Looking forward to it, Shaw.

12038
19:04:54,500 --> 19:04:56,269
Three-eighths ratchet.

12039
19:05:01,400 --> 19:05:03,503
Three-eighths driver.

12040
19:05:03,537 --> 19:05:06,407
Six-inch extension.

12041
19:05:09,700 --> 19:05:10,767
Are you sure?

12042
19:05:22,645 --> 19:05:24,848
Remember what your daddy
told you.

12043
19:05:24,882 --> 19:05:27,418
Be precise in life.

12044
19:05:27,450 --> 19:05:28,852
It can make all the difference.

12045
19:05:28,885 --> 19:05:30,621
Now, watch this.

12046
19:05:31,988 --> 19:05:33,890
- See how it's working now?
- Mm-hmm.

12047
19:05:33,923 --> 19:05:36,193
And you see what's happening?

12048
19:05:36,226 --> 19:05:38,596
It's turning the screw.

12049
19:05:38,628 --> 19:05:40,897
You're right.

12050
19:05:40,930 --> 19:05:42,733
Water heater's out again.

12051
19:05:42,765 --> 19:05:45,602
It's the price we pay
for peace and quiet.

12052
19:05:47,337 --> 19:05:48,873
Want to come and give us a hand?

12053
19:05:52,776 --> 19:05:55,313
Are you expecting someone?

12054
19:05:57,781 --> 19:05:59,417
Brian, remember
what we practiced.

12055
19:06:25,041 --> 19:06:26,710
Yo, yo!

12056
19:06:26,743 --> 19:06:30,647
We come in peace.
We come in peace!

12057
19:06:33,517 --> 19:06:35,786
It's me!

12058
19:06:35,818 --> 19:06:38,255
Roman?
Maybe you don't recognize me

12059
19:06:38,289 --> 19:06:40,291
'cause I've been tanning
all week, bro.

12060
19:06:42,926 --> 19:06:46,231
B, come out, son.

12061
19:06:53,770 --> 19:06:56,273
What you gonna do
with that thing, man?

12062
19:06:56,306 --> 19:06:58,351
What, you out here trying
to kill elephants or something?

12063
19:06:58,375 --> 19:07:00,011
We would've called first.

12064
19:07:00,043 --> 19:07:02,846
Except you actually need phones
in order to get phone calls.

12065
19:07:02,880 --> 19:07:04,447
You know that, right?

12066
19:07:04,481 --> 19:07:06,317
- Little b!
- Wow, you're so big.

12067
19:07:06,349 --> 19:07:07,617
- Hi. - Wow.
- Hi.

12068
19:07:07,651 --> 19:07:10,655
Now, I know you don't carpool.

12069
19:07:10,688 --> 19:07:13,390
So what's up?

12070
19:07:13,423 --> 19:07:14,892
Mayday! Mayday!

12071
19:07:14,925 --> 19:07:17,995
My plane is under attack
by a rogue agent!

12072
19:07:20,531 --> 19:07:23,467
We're being boarded. I've got
dangerous cargo on board.

12073
19:07:23,500 --> 19:07:25,002
I need you to assemble the team.

12074
19:07:25,034 --> 19:07:26,936
Still alive. I'll explain...

12075
19:07:28,805 --> 19:07:32,409
It's an SOS transmission
from Mr. Nobody's plane.

12076
19:07:32,442 --> 19:07:34,512
It came through with
a mess of encrypted data,

12077
19:07:34,544 --> 19:07:36,346
most of which
I'm still trying to crack.

12078
19:07:36,380 --> 19:07:37,890
- Did anybody else get this?
- Well, that's the thing.

12079
19:07:37,914 --> 19:07:40,450
He sent it only to us.

12080
19:07:40,483 --> 19:07:42,587
Why just us?

12081
19:07:51,027 --> 19:07:52,395
He caught Cipher.

12082
19:07:52,428 --> 19:07:54,030
But there was a midair attack,

12083
19:07:54,063 --> 19:07:55,799
and she was extracted.

12084
19:07:55,832 --> 19:07:58,803
It seems his plane crashed
somewhere here,

12085
19:07:58,835 --> 19:08:01,104
over the northwest region
of Montequinto.

12086
19:08:01,137 --> 19:08:03,774
If Mr. Nobody survived,
we need to find him.

12087
19:08:03,806 --> 19:08:05,508
But the whole area's sealed off.

12088
19:08:05,541 --> 19:08:07,010
Isolationist, run by military.

12089
19:08:07,043 --> 19:08:08,979
We're not on call anymore.

12090
19:08:13,649 --> 19:08:14,751
Wait, wait.

12091
19:08:14,784 --> 19:08:17,554
Dom, this is Cipher.

12092
19:08:17,587 --> 19:08:20,825
The woman who killed
the mother of your child.

12093
19:08:24,628 --> 19:08:26,029
Things change.

12094
19:08:31,935 --> 19:08:34,637
Listen, we're wheels up
at 8:00 A.M.,

12095
19:08:34,671 --> 19:08:37,007
if you change your mind.

12096
19:08:37,040 --> 19:08:38,676
Thank you.

12097
19:08:41,411 --> 19:08:43,980
<i>Daddy, do you know where God is?</i>

12098
19:08:44,013 --> 19:08:46,082
- Where is God?
- In your heart.

12099
19:08:46,115 --> 19:08:48,718
He's in your heart, too.

12100
19:08:48,752 --> 19:08:50,421
And you know something?

12101
19:08:50,454 --> 19:08:52,957
I'll always be in your heart.

12102
19:08:52,989 --> 19:08:54,424
Hey, little guy.

12103
19:08:55,124 --> 19:08:56,594
I have a gift for you.

12104
19:08:57,493 --> 19:08:59,629
Your father gave this to me.

12105
19:09:00,863 --> 19:09:03,533
And now I'm gonna
give it to you.

12106
19:09:05,068 --> 19:09:07,438
It's very special.

12107
19:09:07,470 --> 19:09:08,873
Take care of it.

12108
19:09:25,155 --> 19:09:26,891
Good night.

12109
19:09:37,633 --> 19:09:39,836
This isn't who we are.

12110
19:09:43,073 --> 19:09:46,544
Brian and Mia got out of the
game when they became parents.

12111
19:09:48,078 --> 19:09:49,947
We're not them.

12112
19:10:31,021 --> 19:10:33,623
Under attack by a rogue agent!

12113
19:10:33,656 --> 19:10:36,893
We're being boarded. I've got
dangerous cargo on board.

12114
19:10:36,926 --> 19:10:38,195
Assemble the team.

12115
19:10:38,228 --> 19:10:40,131
Still alive. I'll explain...

12116
19:10:41,598 --> 19:10:43,534
alive. I'll explain...

12117
19:11:34,600 --> 19:11:36,569
Coming up on the signal,
two miles.

12118
19:11:36,602 --> 19:11:39,371
It's deep in the militarized
zone of Montequinto.

12119
19:11:39,405 --> 19:11:41,540
- I hope everyone's ready.
- Ready?

12120
19:11:41,573 --> 19:11:43,242
Y'all want to make jokes
about me

12121
19:11:43,275 --> 19:11:45,111
not making practical decisions?

12122
19:11:45,144 --> 19:11:47,080
This is as prepared as it gets.

12123
19:11:47,112 --> 19:11:48,714
We all see you, man.

12124
19:11:48,747 --> 19:11:51,517
Nobody thinks you're
compensating for anything.

12125
19:12:00,760 --> 19:12:03,096
- I'll take point.
- Careful.

12126
19:12:03,129 --> 19:12:05,332
Careful's when you get hurt.

12127
19:12:18,343 --> 19:12:20,179
Right now, we have

12128
19:12:20,212 --> 19:12:21,747
a ten-minute window
between patrols.

12129
19:12:21,780 --> 19:12:23,717
Mr. Nobody's signal is close,

12130
19:12:23,750 --> 19:12:26,186
but we've got
to move quickly, guys.

12131
19:12:26,218 --> 19:12:28,354
We do not want to cross paths
with the military here.

12132
19:12:54,414 --> 19:12:56,482
- It's inside.
- Cover us.

12133
19:13:14,232 --> 19:13:18,170
The source of the SOS signal is
coming from inside this thing.

12134
19:13:21,741 --> 19:13:23,410
Somebody wanted in.

12135
19:13:23,443 --> 19:13:26,478
Plane must have gone down
before they could cut through.

12136
19:13:26,511 --> 19:13:29,415
Or it was sent down
on purpose to stop 'em.

12137
19:13:29,448 --> 19:13:31,517
Yeah, well, their mistake
was trying to cut into it.

12138
19:13:31,550 --> 19:13:34,121
But just give me a minute.
I can get in.

12139
19:13:36,555 --> 19:13:37,723
Dom.

12140
19:13:37,756 --> 19:13:39,659
There's not a soul in sight.

12141
19:13:39,692 --> 19:13:42,095
No sign of Mr. Nobody.

12142
19:13:42,127 --> 19:13:43,696
Got it.

12143
19:13:50,703 --> 19:13:52,371
What the hell is this?

12144
19:13:52,405 --> 19:13:55,342
Whatever it is, Mr. Nobody
wanted us to find it.

12145
19:13:56,108 --> 19:13:57,410
How's that work...

12146
19:13:57,443 --> 19:13:59,279
Go!

12147
19:14:36,515 --> 19:14:39,519
What?! You don't know who I am?!

12148
19:14:39,552 --> 19:14:41,121
You think I'm scared?!

12149
19:16:05,805 --> 19:16:08,208
Roman, where the hell are you?!

12150
19:16:13,945 --> 19:16:17,684
Who's compensating now, Tej?!

12151
19:16:40,873 --> 19:16:43,710
<i>"Peligro minas."</i>
What does that mean?

12152
19:16:43,742 --> 19:16:45,254
Tej, how fast we got to go
to clear 'em?

12153
19:16:45,278 --> 19:16:46,654
Please don't tell me
you're thinking

12154
19:16:46,678 --> 19:16:47,889
- what I think you're thinking.
- Why?

12155
19:16:47,913 --> 19:16:49,716
What does <i>"peligro minas"</i> mean?

12156
19:16:49,749 --> 19:16:51,851
- Tej, how fast?
- I don't know, man.

12157
19:16:51,884 --> 19:16:53,286
Somebody answer me!

12158
19:16:53,318 --> 19:16:54,654
What does <i>"peligro minas"</i> mean?

12159
19:16:54,686 --> 19:16:55,954
<i>"Peligro minas"</i> means

12160
19:16:55,988 --> 19:16:57,924
- "danger, land mines!"
- What?!

12161
19:17:00,859 --> 19:17:02,628
How fast, Tej?

12162
19:17:02,662 --> 19:17:04,364
Assuming a 50-foot blast radius

12163
19:17:04,396 --> 19:17:07,266
and a-a half a second trigger
delay, I'd say about 80.

12164
19:17:07,299 --> 19:17:08,501
I can't!

12165
19:17:08,533 --> 19:17:10,669
My speedometer
only goes up to 70.

12166
19:17:10,703 --> 19:17:12,905
- What do I do?!
- You put your foot to that floor,

12167
19:17:12,937 --> 19:17:13,937
and you pray!

12168
19:18:00,051 --> 19:18:03,455
Get to that palm plantation,
and then we're clear.

12169
19:18:43,596 --> 19:18:44,698
Whoa!

12170
19:18:56,008 --> 19:18:57,777
Whoa!

12171
19:19:00,678 --> 19:19:01,880
Roman, you good?

12172
19:19:05,850 --> 19:19:08,420
My ass is <i>en fuego!</i>

12173
19:19:17,863 --> 19:19:19,499
Tej! Wait! Land mine!

12174
19:20:34,740 --> 19:20:36,776
How in the hell
are you not dead?

12175
19:20:47,219 --> 19:20:49,622
Wait, okay, I think
I found us another way out.

12176
19:20:49,655 --> 19:20:52,258
Two miles to what looks like
a bridge across the border.

12177
19:20:52,290 --> 19:20:55,160
Good. The sooner we get
out of here, the better.

12178
19:20:58,530 --> 19:20:59,933
Letty, on the right.

12179
19:21:37,569 --> 19:21:39,771
The device.

12180
19:22:00,826 --> 19:22:01,895
Get in.

12181
19:22:21,946 --> 19:22:25,050
That was Jakob back there,
wasn't it?

12182
19:22:55,681 --> 19:22:57,850
Always check your mirrors,
bitches!

12183
19:22:58,884 --> 19:23:00,051
Oh, hell no.

12184
19:23:00,085 --> 19:23:01,295
Are we supposed to drive
across that?

12185
19:23:01,319 --> 19:23:03,856
Well, I said
it looked like a bridge.

12186
19:23:16,668 --> 19:23:19,338
Oh, my God!

12187
19:23:39,023 --> 19:23:40,760
The military's not giving up.

12188
19:23:40,792 --> 19:23:42,160
We got to get past the border.

12189
19:24:39,318 --> 19:24:40,453
Where's the bridge?

12190
19:24:44,990 --> 19:24:46,925
No. No, no.

12191
19:24:46,959 --> 19:24:48,227
Dom.

12192
19:25:23,462 --> 19:25:25,397
Well, that was new.

12193
19:25:44,982 --> 19:25:46,985
Look, we're in the clear.

12194
19:25:48,119 --> 19:25:49,921
But this thing is a mess.

12195
19:25:49,954 --> 19:25:52,057
The headlines out there?

12196
19:25:52,089 --> 19:25:55,394
Secret spy plane crashes
in a hostile country?

12197
19:25:55,426 --> 19:25:59,130
Followed by some kind of
covert ops firefight?

12198
19:25:59,164 --> 19:26:01,866
I'll get you where you need...

12199
19:26:01,899 --> 19:26:03,935
And then I'm gonna need
to back off.

12200
19:26:09,241 --> 19:26:10,977
I appreciate the favor.

12201
19:26:14,479 --> 19:26:17,049
I got to stop doing
so many favors.

12202
19:26:19,885 --> 19:26:22,488
What we doing, Ramsey?

12203
19:26:22,520 --> 19:26:23,989
Like, where are we going?

12204
19:26:24,021 --> 19:26:26,891
I-I was able to decrypt the data

12205
19:26:26,924 --> 19:26:28,560
that came through
with Mr. Nobody's SOS,

12206
19:26:28,594 --> 19:26:32,298
and I found GPS coordinates,
definitely included on purpose.

12207
19:26:34,398 --> 19:26:36,835
You knew about Jakob?

12208
19:26:37,903 --> 19:26:40,506
Question: Who is Jakob?

12209
19:26:40,539 --> 19:26:43,375
Jakob is...

12210
19:26:43,407 --> 19:26:45,144
Or was Dom's brother.

12211
19:26:48,312 --> 19:26:50,415
Oh, my-my bad.

12212
19:26:50,449 --> 19:26:53,318
I'm sorry. I'm just processing.

12213
19:26:53,351 --> 19:26:55,520
Brother?

12214
19:26:55,553 --> 19:26:57,422
You got a brother?

12215
19:26:57,455 --> 19:27:01,126
Who also happens to be
some kind of super spy

12216
19:27:01,158 --> 19:27:03,462
with his own private army,

12217
19:27:03,494 --> 19:27:06,064
who drives literally like
a bat out of hell,

12218
19:27:06,097 --> 19:27:08,399
who preplanned an aerial jump

12219
19:27:08,433 --> 19:27:10,869
and landed at the bottom
of an airplane?

12220
19:27:10,903 --> 19:27:12,938
Who does that?

12221
19:27:12,971 --> 19:27:16,275
Who does that? A Toretto.

12222
19:27:25,600 --> 19:27:27,436
Jakob.

12223
19:27:27,470 --> 19:27:29,581
I simply cannot believe that
magnet trick actually worked.

12224
19:27:29,605 --> 19:27:32,442
It looked so damn cool.
Look at this here.

12225
19:27:32,474 --> 19:27:33,842
I got this off the cockpit feed.

12226
19:27:33,876 --> 19:27:35,979
Oh, I love being rich.

12227
19:27:36,012 --> 19:27:38,281
It was sloppy. He almost had me.

12228
19:27:38,313 --> 19:27:41,417
- She say anything?
- Nope. Nada.

12229
19:27:41,449 --> 19:27:44,353
You know, I look at her
and I feel creeped out.

12230
19:27:44,387 --> 19:27:46,888
And sort of turned on
at the same time.

12231
19:27:46,922 --> 19:27:48,958
Is that weird?

12232
19:27:51,827 --> 19:27:53,663
Nice operation.

12233
19:27:53,695 --> 19:27:56,398
You snatched me off
Mr. Nobody's plane midair

12234
19:27:56,432 --> 19:27:58,535
without a scratch,
and you took him down.

12235
19:27:59,534 --> 19:28:00,903
Money well spent.

12236
19:28:02,405 --> 19:28:05,474
- Do you know who I am?
- I know who you are.

12237
19:28:05,507 --> 19:28:06,642
Do you?

12238
19:28:09,011 --> 19:28:11,815
East L.A. is a tough enough
place to grow up.

12239
19:28:13,916 --> 19:28:18,487
But it was your brother's shadow
that turned you into this.

12240
19:28:18,521 --> 19:28:19,556
Isn't it?

12241
19:28:22,491 --> 19:28:26,796
So your whole life, you pushed
yourself to be faster than Dom.

12242
19:28:26,829 --> 19:28:28,732
Smarter than Dom.

12243
19:28:29,831 --> 19:28:32,368
Stronger than Dom.

12244
19:28:33,903 --> 19:28:39,009
Tell me, do you hate him enough
that it keeps you up at night?

12245
19:28:40,909 --> 19:28:42,678
Still?

12246
19:28:45,047 --> 19:28:47,384
All these years later?

12247
19:28:50,985 --> 19:28:52,688
I should've just hired you

12248
19:28:52,722 --> 19:28:55,491
instead of coercing your
brother a couple of years back.

12249
19:28:55,523 --> 19:28:56,958
I don't work
for the competition.

12250
19:28:56,992 --> 19:28:58,661
That's cute.

12251
19:28:58,694 --> 19:29:00,330
You thinking
you're the competition.

12252
19:29:00,362 --> 19:29:02,498
Says the woman in the box.

12253
19:29:05,734 --> 19:29:07,337
Look familiar?

12254
19:29:07,369 --> 19:29:08,838
The other half's hidden

12255
19:29:08,870 --> 19:29:11,907
in one of the agency's
thousands of vaults.

12256
19:29:11,940 --> 19:29:14,710
I need you to find out
which one.

12257
19:29:14,743 --> 19:29:18,414
We secured the master drive here
from Mr. Nobody's plane.

12258
19:29:18,446 --> 19:29:20,049
The rest of the hardware
is a bit dated.

12259
19:29:20,081 --> 19:29:21,917
Pre-Internet.

12260
19:29:21,951 --> 19:29:23,453
To make sure you don't go

12261
19:29:23,485 --> 19:29:25,522
hack into anything
we don't want you to.

12262
19:29:27,423 --> 19:29:30,359
Say you get what you're after.

12263
19:29:30,393 --> 19:29:32,495
A weapon so dangerous
it shouldn't exist

12264
19:29:32,528 --> 19:29:33,529
for another half century.

12265
19:29:33,561 --> 19:29:34,796
What would you do with it?

12266
19:29:34,830 --> 19:29:37,066
Launch some global attack?

12267
19:29:37,099 --> 19:29:39,502
Sell it to the highest bidder?

12268
19:29:39,534 --> 19:29:42,772
Or maybe you see yourself

12269
19:29:42,804 --> 19:29:45,574
as a necessary shock
to the system.

12270
19:29:45,607 --> 19:29:48,710
I bet all you ever wanted
was a hug.

12271
19:29:48,744 --> 19:29:51,848
You read my psych eval.
Good for you.

12272
19:29:51,880 --> 19:29:55,083
I read your second-grade
report card.

12273
19:29:55,116 --> 19:29:57,353
That's what I do.

12274
19:30:06,060 --> 19:30:09,031
Your chin... it's distinctive.

12275
19:30:10,799 --> 19:30:13,835
I know the Torettos have
quite the mixed bloodlines,

12276
19:30:13,869 --> 19:30:16,906
but I never detected
a Nordic strain.

12277
19:30:26,148 --> 19:30:30,520
Finding the two halves of
project Aries is the easy part.

12278
19:30:30,552 --> 19:30:32,587
Add in your brother Dom
to the mix?

12279
19:30:32,621 --> 19:30:34,858
You don't have a chance.

12280
19:30:35,857 --> 19:30:37,993
Plans are in motion.

12281
19:30:41,831 --> 19:30:43,800
Qasar Khan.

12282
19:30:45,567 --> 19:30:46,636
What?

12283
19:30:47,636 --> 19:30:49,139
Genghis Khan's little brother.

12284
19:30:52,974 --> 19:30:54,677
Nobody's heard of him either.

12285
19:31:20,069 --> 19:31:22,237
Talk about off the grid.

12286
19:31:22,270 --> 19:31:24,639
I don't think they had grids

12287
19:31:24,672 --> 19:31:26,442
when this place was built.

12288
19:31:27,676 --> 19:31:29,645
If a ninja turtle pop out on me,

12289
19:31:29,677 --> 19:31:31,647
tell you right now, I'm out.

12290
19:31:31,679 --> 19:31:34,583
No way this place was
sanctioned by the agency.

12291
19:31:34,616 --> 19:31:37,653
This was definitely
Mr. Nobody's secret hideout.

12292
19:31:45,694 --> 19:31:47,130
What now, Dom?

12293
19:31:49,264 --> 19:31:51,533
Whoever Jakob has become...

12294
19:31:53,869 --> 19:31:55,939
and whatever he's up to...

12295
19:32:00,308 --> 19:32:02,878
it's on me.

12296
19:32:02,911 --> 19:32:04,613
And me alone.

12297
19:32:04,900 --> 19:32:06,435
Nah.

12298
19:32:06,469 --> 19:32:10,607
Whatever's on you, it's on us.

12299
19:32:10,639 --> 19:32:12,375
Let's get to work.

12300
19:32:28,100 --> 19:32:32,004
Y'all ever thought about how
many wild missions we been on?

12301
19:32:32,037 --> 19:32:34,173
How we somehow...

12302
19:32:34,207 --> 19:32:36,443
- Always survive?
- Yeah.

12303
19:32:36,475 --> 19:32:38,979
- So far, so good, I guess.
- It's just luck.

12304
19:32:39,012 --> 19:32:40,981
No, no, no, see,
y'all not listening.

12305
19:32:41,013 --> 19:32:43,082
Think about this.

12306
19:32:43,115 --> 19:32:46,218
We've now been
on insane missions

12307
19:32:46,251 --> 19:32:50,122
around the world,
doing what most would say is

12308
19:32:50,155 --> 19:32:51,791
damn near impossible.

12309
19:32:51,825 --> 19:32:54,695
And I ain't got one single scar
to show for it?

12310
19:32:54,727 --> 19:32:56,863
I mean, look at my jacket.

12311
19:32:58,363 --> 19:33:02,401
Those are bullet holes from
14 dudes trying to take my head

12312
19:33:02,434 --> 19:33:04,036
clean off its shoulders.

12313
19:33:04,070 --> 19:33:07,173
We've taken out
cars, trains, tanks.

12314
19:33:07,207 --> 19:33:09,142
I'm not gonna even
mention the submarine.

12315
19:33:09,175 --> 19:33:12,111
And yet we're still here.

12316
19:33:12,144 --> 19:33:13,479
Exactly.

12317
19:33:13,513 --> 19:33:15,348
Ramsey, what happens
when you test a theory

12318
19:33:15,381 --> 19:33:18,417
over and over again only
to come to the same result?

12319
19:33:18,450 --> 19:33:20,019
A hypothesis becomes fact.

12320
19:33:20,053 --> 19:33:21,497
But you're not actually
suggesting that...

12321
19:33:21,521 --> 19:33:23,457
I don't know,
but when the improbable happens

12322
19:33:23,490 --> 19:33:26,426
again and again,
that's more than luck.

12323
19:33:27,459 --> 19:33:29,762
Maybe we're not so normal.

12324
19:33:29,796 --> 19:33:31,498
That's what I'm saying.

12325
19:33:31,530 --> 19:33:33,166
We are not normal.

12326
19:33:33,198 --> 19:33:35,769
Okay, um...

12327
19:33:35,801 --> 19:33:37,738
Just to clarify,

12328
19:33:37,771 --> 19:33:40,439
are you two maybe suggesting
that we're what,

12329
19:33:40,472 --> 19:33:42,208
invincible?

12330
19:33:43,175 --> 19:33:45,745
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

12331
19:33:48,046 --> 19:33:49,916
Or maybe...

12332
19:33:49,948 --> 19:33:51,318
You're just a dumb-ass.

12333
19:33:55,321 --> 19:33:58,992
Take your dumb-ass jacket
with you, man.

12334
19:34:06,332 --> 19:34:08,402
Pretty impressive driving
out there.

12335
19:34:09,868 --> 19:34:11,939
You miss the old life.

12336
19:34:14,140 --> 19:34:15,175
Do you?

12337
19:34:17,810 --> 19:34:18,979
Every day.

12338
19:34:20,814 --> 19:34:22,216
Guys.

12339
19:34:23,349 --> 19:34:26,086
We got a little company.

12340
19:34:26,118 --> 19:34:28,454
Think you know this person.

12341
19:34:29,955 --> 19:34:33,325
- It's so good to see you.
- I missed you.

12342
19:34:33,359 --> 19:34:35,295
Thank you.

12343
19:34:35,327 --> 19:34:37,096
Of course.

12344
19:34:40,300 --> 19:34:42,368
You should've told me.

12345
19:34:44,403 --> 19:34:46,106
She deserved to know.

12346
19:34:47,307 --> 19:34:50,343
Jakob's my brother, too.
I need to be here.

12347
19:34:50,376 --> 19:34:54,247
You get involved here, you put
everything you have at risk.

12348
19:34:56,281 --> 19:34:58,484
Your kids and the whole world
that you built.

12349
19:34:59,519 --> 19:35:01,388
We're all risking something.

12350
19:35:03,155 --> 19:35:05,558
Dom, listen to me.

12351
19:35:05,591 --> 19:35:09,963
My kids and yours are
in the safest hands possible.

12352
19:35:09,995 --> 19:35:11,030
With Brian.

12353
19:35:12,464 --> 19:35:14,535
Our world's grown, Dom.

12354
19:35:15,968 --> 19:35:17,838
I got this one.

12355
19:35:25,400 --> 19:35:27,402
The firewall on this old thing

12356
19:35:27,435 --> 19:35:28,670
is actually pretty good.

12357
19:35:28,703 --> 19:35:31,473
But, you know, port scan,
UDP, message peek,

12358
19:35:31,505 --> 19:35:33,440
pop to root shell, and...

12359
19:35:35,476 --> 19:35:37,779
say hello to project Aries.

12360
19:35:37,812 --> 19:35:39,346
What is it?

12361
19:35:39,380 --> 19:35:40,958
It's what we got from
Mr. Nobody's plane.

12362
19:35:40,982 --> 19:35:43,351
Or at least part of it.

12363
19:35:43,384 --> 19:35:45,320
Aries was designed
to override and assimilate

12364
19:35:45,353 --> 19:35:46,955
anything that runs on code.

12365
19:35:46,987 --> 19:35:48,656
Any computer anywhere.

12366
19:35:48,690 --> 19:35:50,634
If it operates on zeros
and ones, it's vulnerable.

12367
19:35:51,000 --> 19:35:53,903
If you take Aries
and upload it to a satellite,

12368
19:35:53,937 --> 19:35:56,173
it'll spread like a virus.

12369
19:35:56,205 --> 19:35:58,508
Then it'll be a matter of time
before someone can control

12370
19:35:58,542 --> 19:36:01,444
any weapon system...
Traditional, nuclear,

12371
19:36:01,477 --> 19:36:02,946
stuff we haven't even seen yet...

12372
19:36:02,979 --> 19:36:05,415
And just point it
wherever they want.

12373
19:36:05,448 --> 19:36:11,087
Jakob reboots the world order
within minutes.

12374
19:36:11,120 --> 19:36:13,923
Ares is the god of war, right?

12375
19:36:13,957 --> 19:36:15,960
If Jakob gets his hands on this,

12376
19:36:15,993 --> 19:36:19,096
he'll be the god
of damn near everything.

12377
19:36:19,129 --> 19:36:21,065
Because of how dangerous it was,

12378
19:36:21,098 --> 19:36:22,433
the Aries prototype
was recovered

12379
19:36:22,466 --> 19:36:24,502
and split into two halves
by Mr. Nobody.

12380
19:36:24,535 --> 19:36:28,138
Both of which are worthless
without the activation key.

12381
19:36:28,171 --> 19:36:30,440
Jakob now has one of the pieces.

12382
19:36:30,473 --> 19:36:32,843
He'll be going after
the other half next.

12383
19:36:32,875 --> 19:36:36,212
As for the key, it's...
It's vanished.

12384
19:36:36,245 --> 19:36:37,347
So we find it.

12385
19:36:37,381 --> 19:36:39,216
If we're gonna beat Jakob to it,

12386
19:36:39,249 --> 19:36:40,850
we're gonna have to split up.

12387
19:36:40,883 --> 19:36:42,986
Roman, Tej,
I know a couple of guys

12388
19:36:43,020 --> 19:36:45,790
operating out of Germany that
could get us anything we need.

12389
19:36:45,823 --> 19:36:47,223
I'm on it.

12390
19:36:47,256 --> 19:36:48,459
Wait, there's one more thing.

12391
19:36:48,491 --> 19:36:50,160
Mr. Nobody's transmission

12392
19:36:50,194 --> 19:36:52,396
had one name
connected to the key.

12393
19:36:52,428 --> 19:36:55,966
You guys are gonna want
to brace yourselves for this.

12394
19:37:01,404 --> 19:37:03,506
No way.

12395
19:37:03,540 --> 19:37:05,375
That's exactly what I said.

12396
19:37:05,408 --> 19:37:08,111
So you're saying
Han's death is connected

12397
19:37:08,145 --> 19:37:09,346
to all of this?

12398
19:37:09,379 --> 19:37:11,482
He has to have
something to do with it.

12399
19:37:11,515 --> 19:37:12,850
I'll look into it.

12400
19:37:12,883 --> 19:37:14,350
Tej, can you send me

12401
19:37:14,383 --> 19:37:16,486
- all the files you have on Han?
- Yeah.

12402
19:37:16,520 --> 19:37:18,923
I'll go with you.

12403
19:37:18,955 --> 19:37:19,990
Letty.

12404
19:37:22,892 --> 19:37:24,961
I got this the day Han died.

12405
19:37:26,062 --> 19:37:27,497
Mexico.

12406
19:37:27,531 --> 19:37:29,166
Check the postmark.

12407
19:37:29,198 --> 19:37:33,403
Whatever he was up to,
it ended here.

12408
19:37:33,437 --> 19:37:34,939
Tokyo.

12409
19:37:34,971 --> 19:37:38,042
What are you gonna do
about Jakob?

12410
19:37:38,075 --> 19:37:40,444
I'm gonna find him.

12411
19:37:42,946 --> 19:37:44,115
How?

12412
19:37:45,115 --> 19:37:46,517
An old friend.

12413
19:38:18,100 --> 19:38:20,603
<i>...and beating the shortstop.</i>

12414
19:38:20,636 --> 19:38:23,672
<i>Line drive over the head of Gonzalez</i>

12415
19:38:23,705 --> 19:38:25,741
<i>on the field for a base hit.</i>

12416
19:38:27,676 --> 19:38:28,944
<i>Up next...</i>

12417
19:38:32,013 --> 19:38:34,015
Place still looks the same.

12418
19:38:35,850 --> 19:38:38,019
Just like your dad left it.

12419
19:38:38,053 --> 19:38:40,723
I'm looking for Jakob.

12420
19:38:43,859 --> 19:38:46,027
Can't help you, man.

12421
19:38:46,060 --> 19:38:50,899
I know you took Jakob in
after my father died.

12422
19:38:50,933 --> 19:38:53,835
The worst thing
you can do to a Toretto

12423
19:38:53,868 --> 19:38:55,937
is take away their family.

12424
19:38:57,672 --> 19:39:00,575
That's what you did to Jakob.

12425
19:39:00,609 --> 19:39:04,980
You've got people who love you,
count on you, care for you.

12426
19:39:05,013 --> 19:39:07,183
He ain't got no one.

12427
19:39:07,216 --> 19:39:08,918
You get in his way,
this ain't gonna end

12428
19:39:08,951 --> 19:39:10,820
until one of you guys
are in the ground.

12429
19:39:10,853 --> 19:39:13,489
I know you did
the best you could, buddy.

12430
19:39:14,989 --> 19:39:18,627
But we both know he's about
to cause a lot of hurt.

12431
19:39:30,772 --> 19:39:33,543
I did my best
to take care of Jakob.

12432
19:39:35,076 --> 19:39:37,479
But I'm no Jack Toretto.

12433
19:39:54,663 --> 19:39:57,600
You've got to make peace
with the past if you...

12434
19:39:59,734 --> 19:40:01,836
if you want hope for the future.

12435
19:40:09,310 --> 19:40:11,613
He's in London.

12436
19:40:11,647 --> 19:40:13,716
That's all I know.

12437
19:40:24,225 --> 19:40:26,061
Dom.

12438
19:40:29,230 --> 19:40:31,600
I hope you find your peace.

12439
19:40:34,670 --> 19:40:37,707
The chance for peace died
that day on the track.

12440
19:41:01,600 --> 19:41:03,002
<i>Arigato.</i>

12441
19:41:05,736 --> 19:41:07,939
This place is a dead end.

12442
19:41:07,972 --> 19:41:10,942
Do you think Jakob could be
onto the Han connection?

12443
19:41:12,176 --> 19:41:15,180
If he has all the information
we do, probably.

12444
19:41:18,783 --> 19:41:20,719
I never told Dom...

12445
19:41:22,287 --> 19:41:25,323
I stayed in touch with him for
a while after what happened.

12446
19:41:26,890 --> 19:41:29,827
He was over at buddy's
for about a year, and then...

12447
19:41:29,861 --> 19:41:32,064
He was gone with
a message not to follow.

12448
19:41:33,664 --> 19:41:35,343
But after he disappeared,
I was so desperate to find him

12449
19:41:35,367 --> 19:41:38,303
that I would've...
Would've done anything.

12450
19:41:38,336 --> 19:41:40,305
I even broke into
a police archive,

12451
19:41:40,338 --> 19:41:41,839
but I didn't find anything.

12452
19:41:41,872 --> 19:41:43,307
You what?

12453
19:41:43,341 --> 19:41:44,910
You were like 16.

12454
19:41:46,243 --> 19:41:48,046
I did what I had to do.

12455
19:41:49,247 --> 19:41:51,050
Yeah.

12456
19:41:53,751 --> 19:41:55,786
How about you?

12457
19:41:55,820 --> 19:41:57,689
How are you doing?

12458
19:41:57,722 --> 19:41:59,591
It's a change of pace, huh?

12459
19:42:01,392 --> 19:42:03,661
Just as I was remembering...

12460
19:42:05,430 --> 19:42:07,633
who I was,

12461
19:42:07,666 --> 19:42:09,702
everything changed.

12462
19:42:10,769 --> 19:42:12,338
It slowed down.

12463
19:42:13,405 --> 19:42:15,941
There's peace for me
in the chaos.

12464
19:42:15,974 --> 19:42:19,745
It's like I... I need to face
the world head-on or something

12465
19:42:19,778 --> 19:42:21,113
to feel alive.

12466
19:42:22,080 --> 19:42:24,950
Seeing little Brian

12467
19:42:24,983 --> 19:42:28,120
hiding in a hole because
we had unexpected company...

12468
19:42:29,787 --> 19:42:31,356
that got to me.

12469
19:42:32,957 --> 19:42:35,327
We never used to hide.

12470
19:42:37,128 --> 19:42:40,698
Hey, Dom's my brother, but you
will always be my sister.

12471
19:42:41,466 --> 19:42:44,737
Funny how we all have secrets.

12472
19:42:50,475 --> 19:42:52,678
What?

12473
19:42:52,711 --> 19:42:54,946
You got to be kidding me.

12474
19:42:54,979 --> 19:42:56,714
What is it?

12475
19:42:56,747 --> 19:42:59,083
Remember what Han used to say
about Tokyo?

12476
19:43:01,885 --> 19:43:04,055
You mean how
in all the old westerns,

12477
19:43:04,088 --> 19:43:06,033
cowboys would make a run
for the border to get away

12478
19:43:06,057 --> 19:43:08,093
from the law,
how Tokyo was his...

12479
19:43:08,126 --> 19:43:09,294
Mexico.

12480
19:43:13,731 --> 19:43:15,300
No way.

12481
19:43:32,400 --> 19:43:33,937
She's ready to roll.

12482
19:43:33,969 --> 19:43:36,272
No. No!

12483
19:43:36,304 --> 19:43:37,607
No, Sean!

12484
19:43:37,640 --> 19:43:39,308
Tell me you are not modding

12485
19:43:39,341 --> 19:43:40,719
the quick disconnect valve
on the lox line.

12486
19:43:40,743 --> 19:43:41,744
Hey, man, chill out.

12487
19:43:41,777 --> 19:43:43,446
All right? It's all good.

12488
19:43:43,478 --> 19:43:45,814
- That tweak just saved us 0.4 seconds.
- "All good?"

12489
19:43:45,848 --> 19:43:48,451
This isn't <i>Top Gun,</i> Maverick.

12490
19:43:48,484 --> 19:43:49,728
You don't follow
the rules here, you die.

12491
19:43:49,752 --> 19:43:51,888
Hey, come on. That's a bit much.

12492
19:43:51,920 --> 19:43:54,256
When you know what too much
pressure in the lox line

12493
19:43:54,290 --> 19:43:55,458
can do, come talk to me.

12494
19:43:55,491 --> 19:43:56,726
Till then, stay in your lane.

12495
19:43:56,759 --> 19:43:58,594
Yo, you're lucky
to even be in my lane.

12496
19:43:58,627 --> 19:44:00,629
In case you forgot,
I'm the one that figured out

12497
19:44:00,663 --> 19:44:03,533
how to let us build
rocket engines and get paid.

12498
19:44:03,565 --> 19:44:05,768
This whole thing was my idea.

12499
19:44:05,801 --> 19:44:08,404
So who are you gonna trust
with your brilliant idea,

12500
19:44:08,437 --> 19:44:10,707
this glorified mechanic...

12501
19:44:10,739 --> 19:44:12,308
Or a rocket scientist?

12502
19:44:12,341 --> 19:44:14,018
Without me, you'd be
working at Jiffy Lube.

12503
19:44:14,042 --> 19:44:15,377
Guys, guys.

12504
19:44:15,411 --> 19:44:16,446
Look, it's all good.

12505
19:44:16,478 --> 19:44:17,714
Who cares about who did what?

12506
19:44:17,746 --> 19:44:19,482
Kind of hard for you
to do anything

12507
19:44:19,515 --> 19:44:21,293
when you pee your pants
every time you fly, Twinkie.

12508
19:44:21,317 --> 19:44:22,986
Did I hear that right?

12509
19:44:23,018 --> 19:44:25,487
You a runner
and you afraid of flying?

12510
19:44:26,855 --> 19:44:28,790
"Twinkie?"

12511
19:44:28,824 --> 19:44:32,528
So you must be
"Ding Dong" and "Snoball."

12512
19:44:32,560 --> 19:44:34,730
- Right?
- Yo, uh...

12513
19:44:34,763 --> 19:44:36,431
I don't go by that name anymore.

12514
19:44:36,464 --> 19:44:38,900
You went by that name ever?

12515
19:44:38,933 --> 19:44:40,335
Like, ever?

12516
19:44:40,368 --> 19:44:41,737
I... that's-that's-that's...

12517
19:44:43,339 --> 19:44:45,708
- Hey! We're up.
- Oh, good.

12518
19:44:47,442 --> 19:44:48,611
Hey, fellas.

12519
19:44:48,643 --> 19:44:50,580
Y'all seen ten-second cars?

12520
19:44:51,714 --> 19:44:55,352
Well, say hello
to the two-second car.

12521
19:45:02,424 --> 19:45:05,560
Is that a Pontiac Fiero

12522
19:45:05,594 --> 19:45:07,330
strapped to a rocket engine?

12523
19:45:07,362 --> 19:45:09,364
Impressive, I know.

12524
19:45:09,397 --> 19:45:10,432
No.

12525
19:45:10,466 --> 19:45:12,335
No, that's not impressive.

12526
19:45:13,935 --> 19:45:16,372
Eyes up! Here it comes!
Let the race begin!

12527
19:45:33,522 --> 19:45:34,556
Plane's taking off!

12528
19:45:34,589 --> 19:45:36,058
Go, go, go, go!

12529
19:45:52,507 --> 19:45:54,343
Yes!

12530
19:45:55,611 --> 19:45:56,612
We did it!

12531
19:46:03,386 --> 19:46:07,090
Uh... I'm confused.

12532
19:46:07,123 --> 19:46:08,858
Y'all didn't actually
beat the jet.

12533
19:46:08,890 --> 19:46:10,792
It didn't explode.

12534
19:46:10,826 --> 19:46:12,628
- Yeah, or melt.
- Yeah.

12535
19:46:12,661 --> 19:46:14,464
She's still in one piece.

12536
19:46:20,469 --> 19:46:21,938
You mean "pieces?"

12537
19:46:21,971 --> 19:46:26,009
Hey, Jiffy Lube, next time,
will you listen to me?

12538
19:46:27,777 --> 19:46:30,112
Look, we heard y'all could
get us some wheels.

12539
19:46:30,145 --> 19:46:32,582
Preferably the kind
that don't explode.

12540
19:46:32,614 --> 19:46:34,383
Is that possible?

12541
19:46:34,417 --> 19:46:37,386
Well, the Honda dealership's
about 3,000 miles that way.

12542
19:46:37,420 --> 19:46:39,489
Dominic Toretto sent us.

12543
19:46:47,129 --> 19:46:48,964
Who's Dominic Toretto?

12544
19:47:38,700 --> 19:47:40,269
Hmm.

12545
19:47:43,005 --> 19:47:45,208
Nice necklace, Queenie.

12546
19:47:46,441 --> 19:47:49,612
Diamonds and emeralds
never looked so good.

12547
19:47:49,644 --> 19:47:51,882
Dominic Toretto.

12548
19:47:53,548 --> 19:47:56,385
The word on the street is
you got locked up.

12549
19:47:56,418 --> 19:47:59,454
Yeah, well, in and out,
you know.

12550
19:47:59,487 --> 19:48:01,590
When are they gonna learn?

12551
19:48:01,624 --> 19:48:03,559
Some birds can't be caged.

12552
19:48:03,592 --> 19:48:05,929
Are you looking for
one of me sons?

12553
19:48:07,095 --> 19:48:09,431
Not tonight.

12554
19:48:09,465 --> 19:48:12,102
You do the driving,
I'll cut you in for 15%.

12555
19:48:16,104 --> 19:48:18,574
My thieving days are over.

12556
19:48:19,508 --> 19:48:21,111
Mine ain't.

12557
19:48:22,378 --> 19:48:24,280
You coming?

12558
19:48:55,543 --> 19:48:57,346
I'm looking for someone.

12559
19:48:57,380 --> 19:49:00,249
Would've shown up in town
a little while ago.

12560
19:49:00,282 --> 19:49:03,251
A lot of guys,
a lot of resources.

12561
19:49:03,284 --> 19:49:05,354
Oh, yeah, yeah,
word did go round

12562
19:49:05,387 --> 19:49:08,190
on a crew that just turned up,
led by an American.

12563
19:49:14,130 --> 19:49:16,365
Yeah, he bought some arms
off a local seller.

12564
19:49:16,398 --> 19:49:19,335
Rumor had it he was into
something big up in Edinburgh.

12565
19:49:24,407 --> 19:49:26,642
Local seller, huh?

12566
19:49:26,675 --> 19:49:29,211
She wouldn't happen to be
wearing a stolen necklace,

12567
19:49:29,244 --> 19:49:30,445
- would she?
- He paid well.

12568
19:49:30,479 --> 19:49:32,349
What was I supposed to do?

12569
19:49:37,086 --> 19:49:39,088
This geezer was about
your height, actually.

12570
19:49:39,121 --> 19:49:41,391
Similar features.

12571
19:49:42,525 --> 19:49:45,293
Oh, bloody hell, he's not your
cousin or something, is he?

12572
19:49:45,327 --> 19:49:47,363
He's my brother.

12573
19:49:51,166 --> 19:49:52,966
Get the hand brake for me,
would you, darling?

12574
19:50:02,278 --> 19:50:05,148
Glad I'm not the only one with
a family full of eccentrics.

12575
19:50:07,148 --> 19:50:09,018
He offered payment
for something else.

12576
19:50:11,487 --> 19:50:13,023
You.

12577
19:50:40,516 --> 19:50:42,351
You know,
nothing's more powerful

12578
19:50:42,383 --> 19:50:44,186
than the love of family.

12579
19:50:44,220 --> 19:50:47,623
But you turn that
into anger and resentment,

12580
19:50:47,655 --> 19:50:50,360
nothing's more dangerous.

12581
19:50:55,530 --> 19:50:57,266
Dom?

12582
19:50:57,298 --> 19:50:59,802
Don't get yourself killed, okay?

12583
19:50:59,834 --> 19:51:01,603
You're my favorite American.

12584
19:51:26,700 --> 19:51:29,570
This is your kind of party,
isn't it, Dom?

12585
19:51:29,604 --> 19:51:32,674
Beautiful women, best cars,
best everything.

12586
19:51:32,707 --> 19:51:34,676
You know, best security, too.

12587
19:51:34,709 --> 19:51:36,544
I'm Otto.
I'm your brother's partner.

12588
19:51:42,117 --> 19:51:44,151
Well, fi-financier.

12589
19:51:44,184 --> 19:51:45,786
But, you know, my dad,
he's a dictator,

12590
19:51:45,820 --> 19:51:47,756
so we're not talking
regular people rich here.

12591
19:51:47,789 --> 19:51:48,857
No, no, no, no, no.

12592
19:51:48,890 --> 19:51:50,425
Everything you see here, I own.

12593
19:51:50,457 --> 19:51:52,293
These girls, if you want
to meet one of them,

12594
19:51:52,327 --> 19:51:53,628
maybe two, maybe three,

12595
19:51:53,660 --> 19:51:55,496
just let me know.
They're on the payroll.

12596
19:51:55,530 --> 19:51:58,200
I offer a bomb-ass dental plan,
too. Huh?

12597
19:51:58,233 --> 19:51:59,600
Where is Jakob?

12598
19:51:59,633 --> 19:52:01,469
He's inside.

12599
19:52:41,776 --> 19:52:44,312
The brother
you're looking for...

12600
19:52:44,345 --> 19:52:45,881
He's from an old life.

12601
19:52:47,649 --> 19:52:49,784
- He's long gone.
- All I see is the same

12602
19:52:49,816 --> 19:52:52,253
scared little kid
that killed our father.

12603
19:52:54,454 --> 19:52:56,390
That's your mistake.

12604
19:52:58,325 --> 19:53:00,628
The spy game...

12605
19:53:00,662 --> 19:53:02,397
This is my world.

12606
19:53:06,200 --> 19:53:08,202
So here's my offer.

12607
19:53:09,400 --> 19:53:11,069
It's the same one you gave me.

12608
19:53:14,338 --> 19:53:15,674
You leave.

12609
19:53:15,708 --> 19:53:17,677
Now.

12610
19:53:17,710 --> 19:53:22,414
You drive away,
and you never come back.

12611
19:53:22,447 --> 19:53:23,449
Ever.

12612
19:53:23,481 --> 19:53:25,385
A deal?

12613
19:53:26,752 --> 19:53:28,421
I showed you mercy!

12614
19:53:30,889 --> 19:53:32,792
And I won't show it
to you again.

12615
19:53:42,768 --> 19:53:43,869
Toretto.

12616
19:53:45,436 --> 19:53:48,207
Since my dad is head of state,

12617
19:53:48,239 --> 19:53:50,443
it makes me a foreign dignitary

12618
19:53:50,475 --> 19:53:53,278
and this place an embassy.

12619
19:53:53,311 --> 19:53:55,715
Which means you just trespassed

12620
19:53:55,747 --> 19:53:57,348
into my country
and attempted murder.

12621
19:53:57,381 --> 19:53:59,451
So, naturally, I called in
a little favor

12622
19:53:59,484 --> 19:54:01,786
with all my good friends
from Interpol.

12623
19:54:01,819 --> 19:54:05,123
You keep digging around
in the past, Dom,

12624
19:54:05,157 --> 19:54:07,226
you're not gonna like
what you find.

12625
19:54:15,399 --> 19:54:18,237
And here I thought my dad
was a pain in the ass.

12626
19:54:18,270 --> 19:54:22,141
But your family is
a train wreck.

12627
19:54:22,173 --> 19:54:25,344
Well, now that your brother's
finally out of the game,

12628
19:54:25,377 --> 19:54:27,413
it's time we go to Edinburgh.

12629
19:54:27,445 --> 19:54:31,818
Get the second piece, maybe
do a little sightseeing, huh?

12630
19:54:32,984 --> 19:54:34,420
Any news on the key?

12631
19:54:34,453 --> 19:54:36,723
Don't worry about it.
Our men are closing in.

12632
19:54:38,923 --> 19:54:42,528
One week from now, there won't
be a superpower in the world

12633
19:54:42,560 --> 19:54:44,329
can take a piss
without our permission.

12634
19:54:44,363 --> 19:54:46,332
One week from now,
your dad will be asking you

12635
19:54:46,364 --> 19:54:48,399
for an allowance.

12636
19:54:48,433 --> 19:54:49,735
I'd like that.

12637
19:54:51,302 --> 19:54:52,872
I'd like that.

12638
19:55:05,250 --> 19:55:07,118
Whew.

12639
19:55:08,319 --> 19:55:09,387
What's up?

12640
19:55:11,323 --> 19:55:14,059
- Well done, Leysa.
- Please.

12641
19:55:14,091 --> 19:55:17,095
If it wasn't for you, I'd still
be stealing gas in the D.R.

12642
19:55:17,128 --> 19:55:19,164
So, Queenie treating you right?

12643
19:55:19,198 --> 19:55:20,298
Like a <i>princesa.</i>

12644
19:55:20,332 --> 19:55:21,576
I'm her number-one pick,
you know.

12645
19:55:21,600 --> 19:55:23,536
Cara's little sister done good.

12646
19:55:23,569 --> 19:55:25,070
Good?

12647
19:55:25,103 --> 19:55:27,105
You saw my fine ass
in that white dress.

12648
19:55:27,139 --> 19:55:28,873
You see how I been rocking shit?

12649
19:55:28,907 --> 19:55:31,476
All this crew,
this is mine. Huh?

12650
19:55:31,510 --> 19:55:33,145
I been around the world.

12651
19:55:33,177 --> 19:55:34,380
Oh, I almost forgot.

12652
19:55:34,412 --> 19:55:36,314
You might need this.

12653
19:55:36,347 --> 19:55:39,318
Your boy Jakob biometrics
are encoded to this gun.

12654
19:55:39,350 --> 19:55:42,255
You'll have no trouble
tracking him now.

12655
19:56:19,992 --> 19:56:21,360
Hey, Letty.

12656
19:56:22,493 --> 19:56:23,628
Yeah.

12657
19:56:23,662 --> 19:56:26,030
Come look at this.

12658
19:56:26,064 --> 19:56:27,266
What the hell?

12659
19:56:27,298 --> 19:56:30,168
Han never mentioned
a girl, not ever.

12660
19:56:32,371 --> 19:56:34,105
Letty, Mia!

12661
19:56:34,139 --> 19:56:35,208
Down, now!

12662
19:58:31,222 --> 19:58:32,958
You okay?

12663
19:59:34,152 --> 19:59:37,789
<i>Welcome to Saint Giles'
Cathedral of Edinburgh.</i>

12664
19:59:37,823 --> 19:59:42,561
<i>The High Kirk has a history
stretching back over 900 years.</i>

12665
19:59:42,594 --> 19:59:45,096
<i>Renowned for
its stained glass windows,</i>

12666
19:59:45,130 --> 19:59:48,100
<i>you can see
the intricate craftsmanship...</i>

12667
19:59:51,136 --> 19:59:52,771
We're a go.

12668
20:00:00,112 --> 20:00:01,712
Ramsey, talk to me.
What do we got?

12669
20:00:01,746 --> 20:00:03,715
I pulled Jakob's biometric
signature off the gun,

12670
20:00:03,747 --> 20:00:05,317
and the algorithm I've run says

12671
20:00:05,350 --> 20:00:07,419
Jakob's team is
right on top of us.

12672
20:00:07,452 --> 20:00:09,721
Anywhere between
80 and 100 meters.

12673
20:00:09,753 --> 20:00:12,490
80 meters?
That's a lot around here.

12674
20:00:12,524 --> 20:00:15,360
This whole area
seems pretty packed in.

12675
20:00:15,393 --> 20:00:17,362
So, we don't know

12676
20:00:17,395 --> 20:00:20,365
where the secret vault facility
Jakob is looking to hit is,

12677
20:00:20,398 --> 20:00:21,567
now, do we?

12678
20:00:21,600 --> 20:00:23,735
Wouldn't be a secret if we did.

12679
20:00:23,768 --> 20:00:25,471
You know what?

12680
20:00:25,503 --> 20:00:27,639
I'm starting to think
your little English accent

12681
20:00:27,671 --> 20:00:29,741
makes you sound smarter
than you are.

12682
20:00:35,212 --> 20:00:37,181
Man, can I point out
that a good old-fashioned

12683
20:00:37,215 --> 20:00:38,583
tracking chip would've put us

12684
20:00:38,617 --> 20:00:40,252
within like
six feet of this dude?

12685
20:00:40,284 --> 20:00:42,453
But, nah, instead,
we out here with biometrics

12686
20:00:42,487 --> 20:00:44,456
and facial recognition imaging.

12687
20:00:44,488 --> 20:00:46,457
Feels like we looking
for where's Waldo

12688
20:00:46,490 --> 20:00:49,293
- in Harry Potter world.
- Yeah, uh,

12689
20:00:49,327 --> 20:00:52,131
strong argument there, Tej, but
tracking chips follow the chip.

12690
20:00:52,163 --> 20:00:54,198
Before we know it,
we'd be chasing some expensive

12691
20:00:54,231 --> 20:00:56,534
yet tacky jacket
to the dry cleaner's.

12692
20:00:56,568 --> 20:00:59,137
Biometrics, on the other hand,
are impossible to...

12693
20:01:00,639 --> 20:01:02,173
Wait.

12694
20:01:02,207 --> 20:01:04,143
Guys, okay, we have a problem.

12695
20:01:04,176 --> 20:01:05,519
Cameras are going down
all around us,

12696
20:01:05,543 --> 20:01:08,247
and my equipment is
freaking out.

12697
20:01:10,181 --> 20:01:12,283
What the hell, Jimmy?

12698
20:01:12,317 --> 20:01:14,353
Security alert.
Cameras are down.

12699
20:01:16,654 --> 20:01:18,189
Damn.

12700
20:01:18,222 --> 20:01:19,725
You see anything suspicious?

12701
20:01:19,757 --> 20:01:21,559
Uh, where do I start?

12702
20:01:21,592 --> 20:01:25,163
First of all, all of this
looks a little spooky.

12703
20:01:25,197 --> 20:01:27,332
I even seen
these two ladies walking

12704
20:01:27,364 --> 20:01:30,568
with George Washington wigs
on their head from the 1700s.

12705
20:01:30,601 --> 20:01:33,604
I feel like I'm in Transylvania
or some damn where.

12706
20:01:45,984 --> 20:01:48,320
Ramsey,
we're looking everywhere.

12707
20:01:48,353 --> 20:01:49,654
I just grew a new bunion.

12708
20:01:49,688 --> 20:01:51,489
This is hopeless.

12709
20:01:53,291 --> 20:01:54,359
What?

12710
20:01:54,391 --> 20:01:56,528
- You see that?
- See what?

12711
20:01:56,560 --> 20:01:58,229
The ears.

12712
20:01:58,262 --> 20:02:00,231
They got cauliflower ears.

12713
20:02:00,265 --> 20:02:02,168
They fight for a living.

12714
20:02:03,601 --> 20:02:05,836
- Don't worry about it.
- Roman.

12715
20:02:05,869 --> 20:02:08,407
Hey, man, I ordered
a pair of crocs

12716
20:02:08,439 --> 20:02:11,777
three weeks ago,
and I'm still waiting!

12717
20:02:15,313 --> 20:02:17,516
Where are my shoes, man?!

12718
20:02:19,783 --> 20:02:22,554
Man, we really need
to work on your planning.

12719
20:02:24,021 --> 20:02:26,925
Hey, Dom, you should
get down to the cathedral.

12720
20:02:26,957 --> 20:02:28,793
Dumbass here just attacked
some delivery dudes

12721
20:02:28,827 --> 20:02:30,462
'cause he didn't like
their ears.

12722
20:02:32,697 --> 20:02:34,266
Wait, wait, wait.

12723
20:02:34,298 --> 20:02:36,569
H-How much did you say
you paid for that again?

12724
20:02:37,702 --> 20:02:39,871
You know silver
ain't magnetic, right?

12725
20:02:39,903 --> 20:02:42,340
You know what?
Sh... just shut up.

12726
20:02:42,373 --> 20:02:43,708
Just shut up.

12727
20:02:43,742 --> 20:02:45,911
Ramsey, say we had
a big electromagnet

12728
20:02:45,944 --> 20:02:48,647
turned up right around here.

12729
20:02:48,680 --> 20:02:51,483
Wouldn't that disrupt
all electronic signals?

12730
20:02:51,515 --> 20:02:53,417
Including security systems.
That's it.

12731
20:02:53,451 --> 20:02:55,520
That's how Jakob's
getting into the vault.

12732
20:02:59,858 --> 20:03:00,993
Guys?

12733
20:03:01,926 --> 20:03:03,028
Guys?

12734
20:03:05,796 --> 20:03:08,500
Okay, we've got police
coming from all sides.

12735
20:03:08,533 --> 20:03:11,337
- The area's locking down.
- He ain't using roads.

12736
20:03:25,317 --> 20:03:27,653
I got eyes on Jakob.

12737
20:03:36,027 --> 20:03:37,496
I see Otto.

12738
20:03:39,463 --> 20:03:40,966
I'm gonna tail him.

12739
20:03:49,606 --> 20:03:51,976
He's heading towards
a blue Jaguar.

12740
20:03:52,010 --> 20:03:53,311
Okay, follow him.

12741
20:03:53,345 --> 20:03:55,514
Me? I can't.

12742
20:03:55,546 --> 20:03:56,781
Why not?

12743
20:03:56,814 --> 20:03:58,425
Okay, this is a bad time
to tell you this,

12744
20:03:58,449 --> 20:04:00,051
but I don't drive.

12745
20:04:00,085 --> 20:04:02,320
Okay? I never got my license.
I don't know how to drive.

12746
20:04:02,354 --> 20:04:04,556
And, you know, no one
really drives in London.

12747
20:04:04,588 --> 20:04:07,024
Okay? And that is not
my contribution to this group.

12748
20:04:07,058 --> 20:04:08,092
It's you or no one.

12749
20:04:21,605 --> 20:04:22,773
Shit.

12750
20:04:22,806 --> 20:04:24,675
Guys, come on, man.

12751
20:04:24,708 --> 20:04:26,019
I feel like,
between the six of us,

12752
20:04:26,043 --> 20:04:28,346
we can work this out, right?

12753
20:04:36,854 --> 20:04:38,622
Okay. I've got...

12754
20:04:45,829 --> 20:04:47,498
Ramsey, shut it off!

12755
20:04:47,532 --> 20:04:48,734
Shut it off!

12756
20:04:50,167 --> 20:04:51,369
Go, go, go!

12757
20:04:51,403 --> 20:04:53,438
Okay. Uh...

12758
20:04:53,470 --> 20:04:55,673
Brake is on the left,
accelerator right.

12759
20:04:58,609 --> 20:04:59,877
Oh.

12760
20:05:51,162 --> 20:05:52,898
Shit.

12761
20:05:56,868 --> 20:05:57,936
Hey!

12762
20:06:10,914 --> 20:06:12,818
Oh! Sorry!

12763
20:06:30,768 --> 20:06:32,570
Whoa!

12764
20:06:56,860 --> 20:06:58,896
Oh, no!

12765
20:07:00,797 --> 20:07:02,099
Move!

12766
20:07:02,132 --> 20:07:04,001
Hey, that was not my fault!

12767
20:07:12,844 --> 20:07:14,813
Okay, that one was my fault.

12768
20:07:48,813 --> 20:07:50,715
See?

12769
20:07:50,747 --> 20:07:52,817
What'd I tell you?

12770
20:07:52,850 --> 20:07:54,119
Not even a scratch.

12771
20:08:08,699 --> 20:08:10,179
Otto, sending you
new pickup location.

12772
20:08:18,309 --> 20:08:20,279
I've got it.
I'm headed to you now.

12773
20:09:00,051 --> 20:09:01,286
Otto, where are you?

12774
20:09:01,319 --> 20:09:04,089
Jakob, I'm there.
I don't see anybody.

12775
20:09:05,390 --> 20:09:07,125
It's because you're
on the wrong street.

12776
20:09:41,359 --> 20:09:42,827
That's my car, pal!

12777
20:09:42,859 --> 20:09:44,395
Dom!

12778
20:09:48,966 --> 20:09:50,969
Go!

12779
20:09:53,003 --> 20:09:55,407
Damn it.

12780
20:10:26,970 --> 20:10:28,105
You're a natural.

12781
20:10:28,139 --> 20:10:30,909
Of course I am.

12782
20:10:44,322 --> 20:10:45,824
Okay, listen up!

12783
20:10:45,856 --> 20:10:48,460
I want 50 of the best men!
I want guns!

12784
20:10:48,493 --> 20:10:51,796
I want wheels, freaking
x-wing fighters... I don't care!

12785
20:10:51,828 --> 20:10:53,063
The <i>millennium falcon,</i>

12786
20:10:53,096 --> 20:10:54,798
Chewbacca if you can
get a hold of him.

12787
20:10:54,832 --> 20:10:57,135
Money's no object. Go.

12788
20:10:57,167 --> 20:10:59,203
Go!

12789
20:11:08,546 --> 20:11:10,248
What?

12790
20:11:11,815 --> 20:11:13,719
What's so funny?

12791
20:11:14,519 --> 20:11:16,855
I...

12792
20:11:16,887 --> 20:11:19,923
I was thinking,
if this was a movie,

12793
20:11:19,957 --> 20:11:21,359
this would be the moment

12794
20:11:21,391 --> 20:11:25,028
where the villain has
an unexpected setback,

12795
20:11:25,061 --> 20:11:27,798
overcompensates without
thinking it through

12796
20:11:27,832 --> 20:11:29,934
and gets crushed
by the good guys.

12797
20:11:31,502 --> 20:11:36,039
No offense, but you have
no idea what we're about to do.

12798
20:11:36,073 --> 20:11:39,077
And for the record,
we're the good guys.

12799
20:11:39,109 --> 20:11:41,478
Me? I'm Luke freaking Skywalker.

12800
20:11:41,511 --> 20:11:43,113
Are you sure about that?

12801
20:11:43,146 --> 20:11:46,318
I mean, I get
the daddy issues, but...

12802
20:11:48,219 --> 20:11:50,221
Look at what you've built.

12803
20:11:51,521 --> 20:11:53,492
Really? Luke?

12804
20:11:54,591 --> 20:11:56,193
You're right.

12805
20:11:56,226 --> 20:11:58,430
No, I'm more of a Han Solo.

12806
20:11:59,430 --> 20:12:00,999
No.

12807
20:12:03,234 --> 20:12:04,335
You're Yoda.

12808
20:12:04,368 --> 20:12:06,271
- Yoda?
- Mm-hmm.

12809
20:12:06,304 --> 20:12:07,806
No. The little green guy?

12810
20:12:07,838 --> 20:12:09,439
- Yeah.
- No.

12811
20:12:10,841 --> 20:12:13,277
Ah, shit, I'll take it.

12812
20:12:13,310 --> 20:12:15,212
Because he's
a powerful jedi, right?

12813
20:12:15,246 --> 20:12:17,382
No.

12814
20:12:17,414 --> 20:12:19,050
Yoda's a puppet.

12815
20:12:21,452 --> 20:12:24,189
With someone's hand up his ass.

12816
20:12:47,411 --> 20:12:49,380
So what now, Dom?

12817
20:12:49,412 --> 20:12:52,883
No one outruns their past.

12818
20:12:52,917 --> 20:12:54,586
And yours just caught up to you.

12819
20:13:03,895 --> 20:13:05,363
Man.

12820
20:13:05,395 --> 20:13:07,231
There is
literally zero industrial

12821
20:13:07,265 --> 20:13:09,334
or weapons-grade electromagnets
I can find

12822
20:13:09,367 --> 20:13:10,935
that are this powerful.

12823
20:13:10,967 --> 20:13:12,312
Look at the pull strength
level here.

12824
20:13:12,336 --> 20:13:14,439
- It's crazy.
- Yeah.

12825
20:13:14,471 --> 20:13:16,474
Wait, watch this.

12826
20:13:33,490 --> 20:13:35,225
Every time. I can't believe it.

12827
20:13:35,259 --> 20:13:37,060
What are you doing, bruh?

12828
20:13:37,094 --> 20:13:38,395
I'm hungry.

12829
20:13:38,429 --> 20:13:40,364
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, damn.

12830
20:13:40,398 --> 20:13:42,000
Surprise.

12831
20:13:45,435 --> 20:13:47,639
Nice clubhouse.

12832
20:13:58,114 --> 20:13:59,885
'Sup, man?

12833
20:14:04,322 --> 20:14:05,556
Nice to meet you.

12834
20:14:22,038 --> 20:14:24,541
So you got my postcard, huh?

12835
20:14:42,100 --> 20:14:45,670
I'm just still
trying to figure out...

12836
20:14:45,704 --> 20:14:47,773
How are you still alive?

12837
20:14:49,941 --> 20:14:53,312
Well, after Gisele died...

12838
20:14:53,344 --> 20:14:55,381
I didn't know what to do.

12839
20:14:56,381 --> 20:14:57,850
I was aimless.

12840
20:14:59,316 --> 20:15:01,085
- Lost.
- Absolutely.

12841
20:15:01,119 --> 20:15:03,722
But can you get
to the part where

12842
20:15:03,754 --> 20:15:06,124
the car exploded
and you're still alive?

12843
20:15:06,158 --> 20:15:08,060
- Like, I'm trying to...
- Roman, can you...

12844
20:15:08,093 --> 20:15:10,062
Can you just be quiet
for one minute?

12845
20:15:10,094 --> 20:15:12,131
We made plans.

12846
20:15:13,397 --> 20:15:14,932
We had dreams.

12847
20:15:15,900 --> 20:15:18,769
<i>You know, it's funny,
Gisele led me there,</i>

12848
20:15:18,802 --> 20:15:21,773
and I wasn't even
looking for it.

12849
20:15:24,374 --> 20:15:25,743
But it became home.

12850
20:15:27,345 --> 20:15:29,815
Then one day,
Mr. Nobody came calling.

12851
20:15:29,900 --> 20:15:32,003
<i>And all I knew
was that I had to steal</i>

12852
20:15:32,037 --> 20:15:34,874
<i>some tech from the home
of a scientist couple.</i>

12853
20:15:38,744 --> 20:15:41,146
<i>But as usual...</i>

12854
20:15:41,178 --> 20:15:43,615
<i>Mr. Nobody didn't
tell me everything.</i>

12855
20:15:45,083 --> 20:15:47,620
In fact, he left out
the most important part.

12856
20:15:52,356 --> 20:15:54,192
I was 11.

12857
20:15:54,226 --> 20:15:57,162
My parents would take me
to the movies on Saturdays

12858
20:15:57,195 --> 20:15:59,699
if I tried hard in school
during the week.

12859
20:16:00,865 --> 20:16:03,201
<i>I was so excited to go</i>

12860
20:16:03,235 --> 20:16:07,006
<i>I forgot my raincoat,
so I went back in.</i>

12861
20:16:13,712 --> 20:16:15,781
<i>At first, I didn't see it.</i>

12862
20:16:17,915 --> 20:16:19,985
By the time
I looked out the window...

12863
20:16:23,120 --> 20:16:25,123
Mom and dad were gone.

12864
20:16:25,156 --> 20:16:26,800
Turns out I wasn't the only one

12865
20:16:26,900 --> 20:16:28,628
looking for this thing.

12866
20:16:29,200 --> 20:16:30,736
<i>Han saved me.</i>

12867
20:16:30,770 --> 20:16:33,239
<i>Wouldn't leave me behind.</i>

12868
20:16:33,271 --> 20:16:37,876
He knew I'd always be a target,
so he taught me how to survive.

12869
20:16:40,413 --> 20:16:42,349
We became a family.

12870
20:16:44,684 --> 20:16:46,886
"Always be a target?"

12871
20:16:48,820 --> 20:16:50,155
Why?

12872
20:16:50,189 --> 20:16:52,092
'Cause she is the key.

12873
20:16:56,462 --> 20:16:59,832
Everybody's been looking
for a thing.

12874
20:16:59,864 --> 20:17:02,100
It was a person all along.

12875
20:17:02,133 --> 20:17:03,935
My parents didn't want

12876
20:17:03,968 --> 20:17:06,672
project Aries to fall
into the wrong hands,

12877
20:17:06,705 --> 20:17:10,043
so they locked it with their
own DNA, something we share.

12878
20:17:11,377 --> 20:17:13,745
And then, one day,
Mr. Nobody gave me the heads-up

12879
20:17:13,779 --> 20:17:15,882
that one of his best agents
went rogue.

12880
20:17:17,216 --> 20:17:19,118
<i>So when Deckard Shaw
came calling,</i>

12881
20:17:19,150 --> 20:17:20,720
<i>we used it as cover--</i>

12882
20:17:20,800 --> 20:17:23,770
But you got killed
in a car crash, Han.

12883
20:17:25,371 --> 20:17:27,873
Mr. Nobody had a way
of making things look real.

12884
20:17:30,600 --> 20:17:32,269
My death...

12885
20:17:32,303 --> 20:17:34,139
Became the best way
to stay alive.

12886
20:17:39,943 --> 20:17:41,187
- What's happening?
- It's some kind of

12887
20:17:41,211 --> 20:17:42,980
hidden subroutine
the system follows.

12888
20:18:06,569 --> 20:18:08,973
That's it, right there.

12889
20:18:09,006 --> 20:18:11,509
Yeah, nobody moves...

12890
20:18:11,541 --> 20:18:13,510
Everybody lives.

12891
20:18:18,415 --> 20:18:19,818
Jakob.

12892
20:18:21,652 --> 20:18:23,154
I'm sorry, Mia.

12893
20:18:27,056 --> 20:18:29,126
I was the rogue agent.

12894
20:18:29,158 --> 20:18:30,194
Me.

12895
20:18:31,562 --> 20:18:34,031
Dom, you ever think about
how Mr. Nobody found you?

12896
20:18:34,064 --> 20:18:36,534
Think he just dropped
out of the sky and chose you?

12897
20:18:36,567 --> 20:18:40,839
I ran missions with Mr. Nobody
out of this place for years.

12898
20:18:43,540 --> 20:18:46,211
I've been looking for that key
for a long time, Dom.

12899
20:18:47,377 --> 20:18:49,112
And you just handed her over.

12900
20:18:50,346 --> 20:18:51,916
I told you.

12901
20:18:53,082 --> 20:18:54,484
This is my world.

12902
20:18:55,452 --> 20:18:57,955
Got it.

12903
20:18:57,988 --> 20:18:59,590
Got a lot of guys here.

12904
20:18:59,622 --> 20:19:01,893
You trust 'em?

12905
20:19:01,925 --> 20:19:03,026
Trust this.

12906
20:19:08,498 --> 20:19:10,934
You know the only good thing
to come from dad dying?

12907
20:19:14,470 --> 20:19:17,375
If he hadn't, I'd have spent
my entire life in your shadow.

12908
20:19:20,411 --> 20:19:24,482
And now you're gonna spend the
rest of yours living in mine.

12909
20:19:28,152 --> 20:19:31,656
Only good thing
about dad dying...

12910
20:19:31,689 --> 20:19:34,192
Was he didn't have to watch
what you became.

12911
20:19:35,259 --> 20:19:37,462
You never deserved
the Toretto name.

12912
20:19:39,964 --> 20:19:41,465
You think you knew dad, huh?

12913
20:19:41,497 --> 20:19:43,697
What, 'cause you were his
favorite? You don't know shit!

12914
20:19:44,501 --> 20:19:46,203
Okay?

12915
20:19:46,235 --> 20:19:48,139
You want the truth?

12916
20:19:51,108 --> 20:19:53,945
Dad died 'cause he was trying
to throw that race.

12917
20:19:54,711 --> 20:19:56,980
We were in deep debt.

12918
20:19:57,014 --> 20:19:59,617
'Cause of how he felt about you,

12919
20:19:59,649 --> 20:20:01,618
he had to ask me for help.

12920
20:20:01,652 --> 20:20:04,422
How was I supposed to know
that car was gonna blow?

12921
20:20:05,522 --> 20:20:07,591
A good son would've said no.

12922
20:20:08,725 --> 20:20:11,228
And a real brother
would've come to me.

12923
20:20:11,260 --> 20:20:13,031
Come to you?

12924
20:20:17,734 --> 20:20:20,337
He made me promise
you would never find out.

12925
20:20:21,471 --> 20:20:24,108
And through all of it...

12926
20:20:25,074 --> 20:20:26,510
I kept that promise.

12927
20:20:34,018 --> 20:20:35,586
The girl comes with me.

12928
20:20:35,618 --> 20:20:36,653
Jakob!

12929
20:20:40,056 --> 20:20:42,425
I will stop you.

12930
20:20:42,458 --> 20:20:44,228
And that's my promise.

12931
20:20:48,364 --> 20:20:50,001
Hey!

12932
20:20:54,638 --> 20:20:57,108
Sue. Sue. Ah.

12933
20:20:57,140 --> 20:20:58,408
Come on. Come on.

12934
20:21:26,769 --> 20:21:28,071
Down!

12935
20:21:37,814 --> 20:21:39,116
Go! Go!

12936
20:21:39,148 --> 20:21:40,350
Come on!

12937
20:21:51,127 --> 20:21:52,295
This way!

12938
20:22:12,648 --> 20:22:14,684
I'm always here.

12939
20:22:14,717 --> 20:22:15,819
Tell him.

12940
20:22:17,720 --> 20:22:21,157
No...!

12941
20:22:21,190 --> 20:22:23,126
No!

12942
20:23:37,533 --> 20:23:38,702
No!

12943
20:23:57,754 --> 20:23:59,556
<i>Dom.</i>

12944
20:23:59,590 --> 20:24:01,659
<i>Tell me what you see, son.</i>

12945
20:24:08,998 --> 20:24:11,769
See, cars like this
are immortal.

12946
20:24:17,440 --> 20:24:20,277
'70 chargers are
designed so well

12947
20:24:20,309 --> 20:24:24,681
that if you take care of 'em,
they'll run for 100 years.

12948
20:24:24,715 --> 20:24:26,284
Immortal?

12949
20:24:28,684 --> 20:24:30,453
Just like a family, Dom.

12950
20:24:31,854 --> 20:24:34,591
Build it right,
you take care of it...

12951
20:24:35,958 --> 20:24:37,428
it'll live beyond you.

12952
20:24:37,461 --> 20:24:39,530
Daddy.

12953
20:24:47,571 --> 20:24:48,839
Little b.

12954
20:24:48,872 --> 20:24:51,275
When are you coming home?

12955
20:24:51,308 --> 20:24:52,976
Com...

12956
20:25:10,961 --> 20:25:14,332
No. You know I'm good for it.
I promise I'll deliver.

12957
20:25:57,506 --> 20:25:58,750
I'm telling you,
I got intermittent miss.

12958
20:25:58,774 --> 20:26:00,344
- Last two laps.
- On it!

12959
20:26:00,376 --> 20:26:02,446
Get those plug wires!

12960
20:26:03,613 --> 20:26:06,483
Jakob! Now.

12961
20:26:30,674 --> 20:26:32,643
You're good!

12962
20:26:49,592 --> 20:26:52,729
No!

12963
20:27:37,907 --> 20:27:40,042
You came to me, Letty.

12964
20:27:40,076 --> 20:27:45,082
None of it is worth a thing
if I lose you.

12965
20:27:45,114 --> 20:27:47,650
Do you hear me?

12966
20:27:49,452 --> 20:27:51,654
Is this who we are?

12967
20:27:56,725 --> 20:27:58,562
Yeah.

12968
20:28:03,199 --> 20:28:04,867
From here, things move quickly.

12969
20:28:04,900 --> 20:28:06,569
Jakob has all the pieces
he needs.

12970
20:28:06,603 --> 20:28:08,005
Once he activates Aries,

12971
20:28:08,037 --> 20:28:09,781
all he needs to do is
send the signal global.

12972
20:28:09,805 --> 20:28:11,641
And then there's
no stopping him, ever.

12973
20:28:11,675 --> 20:28:14,043
He'll have to launch
some kind of pirate satellite,

12974
20:28:14,077 --> 20:28:16,113
something that'll act
as an amplifier,

12975
20:28:16,145 --> 20:28:18,681
infecting other satellites
in orbit one by one.

12976
20:28:18,715 --> 20:28:21,452
So we find him, stop him,
and then we get Elle back.

12977
20:28:21,484 --> 20:28:23,019
Our odds are zero here, Han.

12978
20:28:23,053 --> 20:28:24,988
Satellite equipment is
easy enough to track,

12979
20:28:25,020 --> 20:28:26,756
but we're not gonna
beat Jakob to a launch.

12980
20:28:26,790 --> 20:28:28,524
Which gives us
a two-target problem:

12981
20:28:28,558 --> 20:28:30,461
Jakob on the ground...

12982
20:28:30,493 --> 20:28:31,995
With his own private army.

12983
20:28:32,028 --> 20:28:34,031
- And the satellite.
- Which can't be hacked.

12984
20:28:34,064 --> 20:28:35,833
Not remotely.
We'd have to do it physically,

12985
20:28:35,866 --> 20:28:39,203
50 miles above ground while
the satellite is in orbit.

12986
20:28:39,235 --> 20:28:41,104
Orbit?

12987
20:28:41,136 --> 20:28:42,639
We need help.

12988
20:28:42,671 --> 20:28:44,541
Otherwise, we have no chance.

12989
20:28:45,541 --> 20:28:46,743
We do it ourselves.

12990
20:28:47,745 --> 20:28:50,814
It's where we've been
that got us this far.

12991
20:28:50,846 --> 20:28:52,882
No. No, no, no, no, no.

12992
20:28:52,916 --> 20:28:55,185
Do y'all not understand?

12993
20:28:55,217 --> 20:28:56,987
Clearly, y'all don't.

12994
20:28:57,019 --> 20:29:00,056
Because if you did,
you'd be pissing your pants

12995
20:29:00,090 --> 20:29:01,190
like a normal person.

12996
20:29:01,224 --> 20:29:02,626
Orbit.

12997
20:29:02,658 --> 20:29:04,495
That's outer space.

12998
20:29:04,528 --> 20:29:06,830
That's another level.

12999
20:29:06,863 --> 20:29:09,900
What we gonna do?
Hijack a space shuttle?

13000
20:29:09,933 --> 20:29:11,202
Put rockets on our backs?

13001
20:29:13,002 --> 20:29:15,005
That's exactly
what we're gonna do.

13002
20:29:15,037 --> 20:29:16,672
What?

13003
20:29:31,086 --> 20:29:33,055
There goes my father's
diplomatic ties

13004
20:29:33,089 --> 20:29:34,524
with Eastern Europe.

13005
20:29:34,558 --> 20:29:35,800
This place is
going to be crawling

13006
20:29:35,824 --> 20:29:37,760
with every cop in the city.

13007
20:29:37,793 --> 20:29:39,863
Time to get the hell
out of here.

13008
20:30:00,116 --> 20:30:01,551
Keep her close.

13009
20:30:12,127 --> 20:30:14,264
It's activated.

13010
20:30:17,600 --> 20:30:19,111
As soon as the satellite
reaches orbit,

13011
20:30:19,135 --> 20:30:21,238
we start the uplink.

13012
20:30:24,107 --> 20:30:26,777
Ah, damn.

13013
20:30:26,809 --> 20:30:28,946
What?

13014
20:30:28,979 --> 20:30:30,714
You see that?

13015
20:30:30,747 --> 20:30:33,183
We can't have an air leak, man.

13016
20:30:35,918 --> 20:30:38,654
Are you really patching
yourself up with duct tape?

13017
20:30:38,688 --> 20:30:39,922
Yes.

13018
20:30:39,956 --> 20:30:41,625
I don't know
if you noticed or not,

13019
20:30:41,657 --> 20:30:43,993
but this whole operation is
band-aids and duct tape.

13020
20:30:44,027 --> 20:30:45,996
Man, this is insane.

13021
20:30:46,028 --> 20:30:48,364
We are headed to outer space.

13022
20:30:48,398 --> 20:30:51,134
You acting like
we on our way to home depot.

13023
20:30:51,166 --> 20:30:52,602
This is ridiculous, man.

13024
20:30:52,635 --> 20:30:54,136
I'm about to abort
this whole mission

13025
20:30:54,170 --> 20:30:56,373
and take my black ass home.

13026
20:30:56,406 --> 20:30:59,076
We're literally gonna be
in a perpetual freefall.

13027
20:30:59,108 --> 20:31:00,076
Freefall?

13028
20:31:00,109 --> 20:31:01,678
What does that even mean?

13029
20:31:01,711 --> 20:31:04,348
Roman, it means
numbers don't lie.

13030
20:31:04,381 --> 20:31:06,350
As long as we obey
the laws of physics,

13031
20:31:06,382 --> 20:31:09,086
then we'll be fine, okay?

13032
20:31:09,118 --> 20:31:11,054
It's just all math and science.

13033
20:31:11,086 --> 20:31:13,089
I knew I should've listened
to my teachers.

13034
20:31:13,122 --> 20:31:14,657
Four minutes to launch.

13035
20:31:14,690 --> 20:31:16,159
You fellas good to go?

13036
20:31:17,860 --> 20:31:20,138
Yeah, we just up here putting
a bunch of duct tape on shit.

13037
20:31:20,162 --> 20:31:22,632
You know, that's what Tej do.

13038
20:31:22,666 --> 20:31:25,302
Man, please hurry up so I can
stop hearing his damn mouth.

13039
20:31:25,335 --> 20:31:28,005
- Yes, we're good to go.
- We're not good.

13040
20:31:28,037 --> 20:31:30,741
This is the same car
that we watched

13041
20:31:30,773 --> 20:31:32,241
do a test run and explode.

13042
20:31:32,274 --> 20:31:34,810
- This is not smart, Tej.
- Don't worry, man.

13043
20:31:34,844 --> 20:31:37,346
With my ceramic polymer coating,
you're gonna be just fine.

13044
20:31:37,380 --> 20:31:39,984
You're 100% fireproof.

13045
20:31:40,817 --> 20:31:41,885
Exactly.

13046
20:31:41,917 --> 20:31:43,687
All eight thrusters

13047
20:31:43,720 --> 20:31:45,022
fully functional.

13048
20:31:48,023 --> 20:31:49,425
Hey, please don't tell me

13049
20:31:49,458 --> 20:31:51,428
you're still running
launch simulations.

13050
20:31:51,461 --> 20:31:53,797
Virgin galactic launched
at 36,000 feet.

13051
20:31:53,830 --> 20:31:56,433
The space shuttle tests
around 50,000 feet.

13052
20:31:56,465 --> 20:31:58,134
Our last test run
with this load means

13053
20:31:58,167 --> 20:31:59,378
we'll have to go higher...
Way higher!

13054
20:31:59,402 --> 20:32:01,038
If we don't get them
high enough,

13055
20:32:01,071 --> 20:32:03,006
these guys are gonna be
pancakes at IHOP

13056
20:32:03,038 --> 20:32:04,316
before the coffee
even gets to the table.

13057
20:32:04,340 --> 20:32:05,708
Hey!

13058
20:32:05,742 --> 20:32:06,976
We can still hear you!

13059
20:32:07,010 --> 20:32:09,246
Don't worry, guys. We got this.

13060
20:32:09,278 --> 20:32:11,114
We do got this, right?

13061
20:32:41,110 --> 20:32:43,345
I've run thermal imaging.
Elle's in the armory truck.

13062
20:32:43,379 --> 20:32:45,047
And I've got a lock
on the Aries signal.

13063
20:32:45,081 --> 20:32:46,392
It's coming from
the beast up ahead.

13064
20:32:46,416 --> 20:32:47,984
We need to get in there
to deactivate it

13065
20:32:48,016 --> 20:32:49,394
by the time Roman and Tej
are in position.

13066
20:32:49,418 --> 20:32:52,022
Ramsey, power us up.

13067
20:32:55,291 --> 20:32:57,860
Satellite is in low orbit.

13068
20:32:59,362 --> 20:33:00,464
Begin.

13069
20:33:16,446 --> 20:33:18,881
All right,
we're passing 50,000 feet!

13070
20:33:18,915 --> 20:33:20,884
Time to get ready, boys.

13071
20:33:20,916 --> 20:33:22,451
What we supposed to be doing

13072
20:33:22,484 --> 20:33:25,087
with these old-ass suits

13073
20:33:25,121 --> 20:33:26,823
that ain't been used
since world war I?

13074
20:33:26,855 --> 20:33:28,324
Oh, I'm sorry.

13075
20:33:28,358 --> 20:33:31,394
Astronauts "r" us was closed
for shopping today.

13076
20:33:31,426 --> 20:33:34,230
Listen, these suits are
just like space suits.

13077
20:33:34,264 --> 20:33:36,166
They both account
for pressure differential.

13078
20:33:36,198 --> 20:33:37,833
Only thing is we may

13079
20:33:37,867 --> 20:33:39,870
blow up like balloons
just a little bit.

13080
20:33:39,903 --> 20:33:41,147
- That's the only difference.
- What?

13081
20:33:41,171 --> 20:33:42,873
We just hit the launch altitude.

13082
20:33:42,906 --> 20:33:45,041
- You guys ready for a five count?
- No, man!

13083
20:33:45,073 --> 20:33:48,411
I'm barely ready to go scuba
diving in this old-ass thing.

13084
20:33:48,443 --> 20:33:50,045
Don't listen to him. We ready!

13085
20:33:50,078 --> 20:33:51,380
- "We?"
- Yes, I said "we!"

13086
20:33:51,413 --> 20:33:53,149
I thought you was invincible.

13087
20:33:53,183 --> 20:33:55,484
Let's see how invincible
your black ass is after this.

13088
20:33:55,518 --> 20:33:57,287
- Punch it!
- No! Tej!

13089
20:34:00,590 --> 20:34:03,260
Oh, my God! I don't want to die!

13090
20:34:03,292 --> 20:34:05,062
Ignition!

13091
20:34:49,205 --> 20:34:52,475
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

13092
20:34:56,211 --> 20:34:58,047
We're in outer space!

13093
20:34:59,148 --> 20:35:02,252
Told you numbers don't lie.

13094
20:35:02,284 --> 20:35:04,321
This is crazy, bro!

13095
20:35:15,364 --> 20:35:17,500
Man, how much candy did you eat?

13096
20:35:17,532 --> 20:35:20,336
Well, I-I... I eat candy
when I get nervous.

13097
20:35:29,800 --> 20:35:32,869
I thought you said
you took care of this.

13098
20:35:33,270 --> 20:35:35,273
Yeah. Hey.

13099
20:35:35,306 --> 20:35:38,476
You take them back to the
freaking junkyard right now!

13100
20:37:14,005 --> 20:37:15,507
All right, Han, Mia, you're up!

13101
20:37:29,054 --> 20:37:30,422
Now.

13102
20:37:36,161 --> 20:37:37,997
Letty.

13103
20:37:57,515 --> 20:37:58,984
Han!

13104
20:38:57,108 --> 20:38:58,610
Not all of us.

13105
20:39:12,390 --> 20:39:15,527
Now, the satellite we looking
for should be somewhere...

13106
20:39:15,559 --> 20:39:17,361
There.

13107
20:39:17,394 --> 20:39:18,663
Right there. You see it?

13108
20:39:18,697 --> 20:39:20,265
Got it.

13109
20:39:20,297 --> 20:39:22,533
Tell me you know
how to work the thrusters.

13110
20:39:22,567 --> 20:39:26,104
Tej, numbers is
what you do, right?

13111
20:39:27,104 --> 20:39:29,140
Driving is what I do.

13112
20:39:36,046 --> 20:39:39,250
Two dudes from the ghetto...
Outer space.

13113
20:39:41,251 --> 20:39:43,254
You know ain't nobody
gonna believe us, right?

13114
20:39:43,287 --> 20:39:45,489
You're right.

13115
20:39:53,631 --> 20:39:55,567
Something's wrong with
the satellite array.

13116
20:39:55,599 --> 20:39:58,202
It's, uh, interfering
with the uplink.

13117
20:40:00,537 --> 20:40:02,473
I'll handle it.

13118
20:40:20,425 --> 20:40:21,460
Han?

13119
20:40:22,659 --> 20:40:24,629
Grab the wheel.

13120
20:40:24,662 --> 20:40:26,131
Something's up.

13121
20:40:27,665 --> 20:40:30,069
I think I can link
into their feed.

13122
20:40:42,212 --> 20:40:44,549
- Something you want to tell me, Otto?
- My bad.

13123
20:40:44,582 --> 20:40:47,552
Satellite uplink is
actually going splendid.

13124
20:40:47,585 --> 20:40:50,322
Oh, and by the way,
I have a new business partner.

13125
20:40:50,354 --> 20:40:52,357
Maybe you know her.

13126
20:40:52,390 --> 20:40:55,293
Guess who's
out of the box, Jakob.

13127
20:40:55,326 --> 20:40:57,363
But I did try to warn you.

13128
20:40:59,764 --> 20:41:02,067
You were never my competition.

13129
20:41:02,099 --> 20:41:04,802
- Otto, there's something you should know.
- Yeah, go on.

13130
20:41:04,836 --> 20:41:07,105
- Lay it on me, dude.
- You're a spoiled rich prick,

13131
20:41:07,138 --> 20:41:09,640
- and I'm gonna kill you.
- Oh, man, I am so sorry.

13132
20:41:09,674 --> 20:41:11,475
No one told you, huh?

13133
20:41:11,509 --> 20:41:15,546
Spoiled rich pricks
run the world.

13134
20:42:38,696 --> 20:42:41,699
Come on. Come on!

13135
20:43:00,318 --> 20:43:01,552
Go.

13136
20:43:41,291 --> 20:43:43,327
- What's happening?
- Uh, well,

13137
20:43:43,360 --> 20:43:46,698
we appear to have lost
our escort and Jakob.

13138
20:43:46,730 --> 20:43:48,433
And, well, Dom is making things

13139
20:43:48,465 --> 20:43:50,234
a little bit difficult here,
but it's fine.

13140
20:43:50,268 --> 20:43:52,237
Really, it's peachy.
Don't worry, don't worry.

13141
20:43:52,269 --> 20:43:53,738
I'll finish this myself.

13142
20:43:57,875 --> 20:44:00,779
All right, let's see
what that beast is made of.

13143
20:44:00,812 --> 20:44:02,247
You ready, Elle?

13144
20:44:15,425 --> 20:44:17,294
Crank it.

13145
20:44:17,327 --> 20:44:19,363
If we can't break through,
we stop it.

13146
20:44:50,327 --> 20:44:52,596
Guys, that thing is
not slowing down

13147
20:44:52,630 --> 20:44:54,299
and the download's almost done.

13148
20:44:54,332 --> 20:44:57,502
Dom, we don't get
out of here now, we're dead.

13149
20:45:06,677 --> 20:45:08,747
Letty, drop back and line up
with the front tires.

13150
20:45:08,779 --> 20:45:10,447
What?

13151
20:45:10,480 --> 20:45:11,991
If we can't slow it
and we can't punch through,

13152
20:45:12,015 --> 20:45:14,385
we flip it
and we hit the underside.

13153
20:45:14,418 --> 20:45:16,988
Goddamn it!
Why do I have to say this?

13154
20:45:17,020 --> 20:45:18,756
Flatten these clowns!

13155
20:45:37,341 --> 20:45:39,009
- Letty, the wires.
- You read my mind.

13156
20:45:39,042 --> 20:45:40,778
Han, get in front of me.

13157
20:45:42,779 --> 20:45:44,882
Dom, I can't get to you.

13158
20:45:45,882 --> 20:45:47,452
But I can.

13159
20:47:02,760 --> 20:47:04,996
All right,
the satellite is in range.

13160
20:47:05,028 --> 20:47:06,830
Let's power up these magnets
and fry it.

13161
20:47:06,863 --> 20:47:08,433
All right, take our time.

13162
20:47:18,809 --> 20:47:20,411
Okay. All right.

13163
20:47:21,912 --> 20:47:24,715
- Tej!
- Hold on. Come on, baby.

13164
20:47:24,748 --> 20:47:26,483
Power up. Power up.

13165
20:47:29,153 --> 20:47:30,455
Shit.

13166
20:47:30,488 --> 20:47:32,824
- Shit, shit, shit.
- What?

13167
20:47:32,857 --> 20:47:34,692
Talk to me. What's going on?

13168
20:47:34,724 --> 20:47:36,736
The pressure of the launch...
It must have jammed the cables

13169
20:47:36,760 --> 20:47:38,495
to the power source.

13170
20:47:38,528 --> 20:47:41,598
Damn it, how did I
not think of that?

13171
20:47:41,631 --> 20:47:43,600
Guys, where are you?

13172
20:47:43,634 --> 20:47:46,904
The upload is almost complete.

13173
20:47:46,938 --> 20:47:49,774
Why don't you just kill it?

13174
20:47:49,806 --> 20:47:51,876
Let's smash it.
Let's run it over, right?

13175
20:47:51,908 --> 20:47:55,913
No. If we crash into that
satellite, we'll probably die.

13176
20:47:55,947 --> 20:47:57,515
And even if we don't,

13177
20:47:57,547 --> 20:47:59,516
the fuel that it would take
to smash it...

13178
20:47:59,550 --> 20:48:01,786
We'd be stuck out here forever.

13179
20:48:01,818 --> 20:48:03,455
You got to have faith, bro.

13180
20:48:03,488 --> 20:48:06,057
Faith? Faith is not numbers.

13181
20:48:06,090 --> 20:48:07,893
You know what, Tej?

13182
20:48:09,092 --> 20:48:10,795
You're probably right.

13183
20:48:13,197 --> 20:48:14,900
<i>We're not invincible.</i>

13184
20:48:17,134 --> 20:48:20,971
<i>We probably just been lucky
this whole time.</i>

13185
20:48:26,777 --> 20:48:28,747
<i>This might be it.</i>

13186
20:48:31,215 --> 20:48:33,952
<i>But you know what?</i>

13187
20:48:33,984 --> 20:48:35,620
<i>If we're gonna go out...</i>

13188
20:48:37,587 --> 20:48:39,690
let's go out
on top of the world.

13189
20:48:40,858 --> 20:48:42,894
Guys, what's happening up there?

13190
20:48:42,926 --> 20:48:44,996
We've got seconds left.

13191
20:48:46,831 --> 20:48:48,766
Let's do it.

13192
20:48:48,799 --> 20:48:49,835
Let's go.

13193
20:48:54,671 --> 20:48:57,708
Five, four, three,

13194
20:48:57,742 --> 20:48:59,845
two, one.

13195
20:49:18,062 --> 20:49:19,930
We did it.

13196
20:49:19,964 --> 20:49:21,632
We did it!

13197
20:49:21,666 --> 20:49:23,301
Let's go.

13198
20:49:23,333 --> 20:49:24,868
Yes!

13199
20:49:24,902 --> 20:49:26,904
Shit.

13200
20:49:26,938 --> 20:49:28,306
Not bad, man.

13201
20:49:28,339 --> 20:49:29,940
Not bad at all.

13202
20:49:41,800 --> 20:49:44,336
Hold on!

13203
20:49:51,676 --> 20:49:52,746
Dom!

13204
20:50:45,500 --> 20:50:47,637
Yes!

13205
20:50:53,307 --> 20:50:55,110
Got to be kidding me.

13206
20:51:30,500 --> 20:51:32,000
Shit!

13207
20:52:24,400 --> 20:52:26,437
Think these belong to you.

13208
20:52:35,544 --> 20:52:39,048
There's gonna be a lot of
people coming after you, Jake.

13209
20:52:39,082 --> 20:52:41,218
Yeah.

13210
20:52:41,250 --> 20:52:43,052
This is the world I chose, Dom.

13211
20:52:44,954 --> 20:52:48,058
You know, dad wasn't perfect.

13212
20:52:48,091 --> 20:52:50,460
And he loved us all the same.

13213
20:52:53,929 --> 20:52:57,767
Someone once gave me
a ten-second car...

13214
20:52:57,801 --> 20:52:59,770
As a second chance.

13215
20:53:01,303 --> 20:53:03,740
I owe you that, little brother.

13216
20:53:16,985 --> 20:53:19,421
I lost you once.

13217
20:53:19,454 --> 20:53:21,357
Don't let that
happen again, okay?

13218
20:54:02,397 --> 20:54:05,067
We come in peace!

13219
20:54:05,101 --> 20:54:06,904
Hey!

13220
20:54:35,131 --> 20:54:37,868
This was the last place
I saw your grandfather.

13221
20:54:39,968 --> 20:54:41,337
This is where he raced.

13222
20:54:41,370 --> 20:54:43,940
Did you race here, too, daddy?

13223
20:54:43,972 --> 20:54:45,140
No.

13224
20:54:45,173 --> 20:54:47,210
But I'll tell you something.

13225
20:54:49,311 --> 20:54:51,314
Everything I needed
to know about life,

13226
20:54:51,347 --> 20:54:52,949
I learned on this track.

13227
20:54:52,981 --> 20:54:54,283
You did?

13228
20:54:55,250 --> 20:54:56,953
I did.

13229
20:55:18,700 --> 20:55:21,037
- Fellas.
- Hey.

13230
20:55:25,807 --> 20:55:27,743
<i>What?</i>

13231
20:55:27,777 --> 20:55:30,413
<i>No way.</i>

13232
20:55:41,222 --> 20:55:43,325
What's going on?

13233
20:55:44,659 --> 20:55:47,529
I couldn't believe it
when I heard you were alive.

13234
20:55:52,068 --> 20:55:54,137
It's a long story.

13235
20:55:55,000 --> 20:55:57,203
But for now, let's just
enjoy the moment, huh?

13236
20:55:57,236 --> 20:55:58,970
Guys, this is Elle.

13237
20:55:59,004 --> 20:56:01,140
Hey, Elle. I'm Sean.

13238
20:56:01,173 --> 20:56:03,009
<i>Just call me "T."</i>

13239
20:56:03,041 --> 20:56:04,843
<i>- I'm Earl.
- Nice to meet you.</i>

13240
20:56:05,811 --> 20:56:07,613
Mia.

13241
20:56:11,282 --> 20:56:13,352
Hi. Nice to finally meet you.

13242
20:56:22,695 --> 20:56:25,031
- Hey, guys.
- Mm. - Hey.

13243
20:56:25,063 --> 20:56:27,133
How much longer on this food?

13244
20:56:27,165 --> 20:56:29,869
Like, I'm-I'm...
I'm ready to eat now.

13245
20:56:29,902 --> 20:56:32,304
I've been eating space food
for weeks.

13246
20:56:32,336 --> 20:56:35,807
Oh. So tootsie rolls
are space food?

13247
20:56:35,840 --> 20:56:36,976
'Cause that's all you ate.

13248
20:56:37,009 --> 20:56:38,744
It was fat free, bruh.

13249
20:56:38,777 --> 20:56:40,179
Snickers and Twix fat free, too?

13250
20:56:40,211 --> 20:56:42,013
- My forehead hungry.
- Yeah, okay.

13251
20:56:42,046 --> 20:56:44,166
- I'll see you later.
- Y-Your forehead is overweight.

13252
20:56:44,982 --> 20:56:46,251
Oh!

13253
20:56:47,218 --> 20:56:50,088
You drive just like your dad.

13254
20:56:50,121 --> 20:56:53,159
- I do?
- Mm-hmm.

13255
20:56:53,192 --> 20:56:55,227
Do you know, this is...

13256
20:56:55,259 --> 20:56:57,796
This is where I met your mom
for the first time.

13257
20:56:57,830 --> 20:56:59,365
Right there.

13258
20:56:59,397 --> 20:57:01,800
She's watching over you
from heaven.

13259
20:57:01,834 --> 20:57:03,903
- She is?
- Mm-hmm.

13260
20:57:06,804 --> 20:57:09,142
I think daddy has
a question for you.

13261
20:57:13,445 --> 20:57:15,748
You ready to say grace, kid?

13262
20:57:15,780 --> 20:57:17,716
But I don't know what to say.

13263
20:57:18,484 --> 20:57:20,019
Oh, it's easy.

13264
20:57:21,252 --> 20:57:23,321
Just say whatever's
in your heart.

13265
20:57:23,354 --> 20:57:24,389
You ready?

13266
20:57:24,422 --> 20:57:25,724
- Mm-hmm.
- Come on.

13267
20:57:32,797 --> 20:57:34,099
Hey, guys.

13268
20:57:34,133 --> 20:57:36,334
Hey.

13269
20:57:36,368 --> 20:57:38,336
Little Brian's ready
to say grace with us.

13270
20:57:38,369 --> 20:57:40,839
- Uh-huh.
- Nice.

13271
20:57:40,873 --> 20:57:43,041
Now, hold on.

13272
20:57:43,074 --> 20:57:44,843
There's still an empty chair.

13273
20:57:45,811 --> 20:57:47,011
He's on the way.

13274
20:58:45,400 --> 20:58:47,203
Thank you.

13275
20:58:47,236 --> 20:58:48,903
Please.

13276
20:58:48,936 --> 20:58:50,749
I tell you where the drive is,
the plans we stole.

13277
20:58:50,773 --> 20:58:52,073
I tell you where it is.

13278
20:58:52,106 --> 20:58:53,475
You mean this drive?

13279
20:58:54,443 --> 20:58:56,045
These plans?

13280
20:58:57,880 --> 20:58:59,749
But you already got it.

13281
20:58:59,782 --> 20:59:01,784
Yes, mate.

13282
20:59:01,817 --> 20:59:03,885
How else do you think
I stay in this good of shape?

13283
20:59:09,558 --> 20:59:11,359
Don't go anywhere.
